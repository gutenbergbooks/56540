<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c005'>WHEREVER I have gone in the last fifteen years
in following my calling as a teacher of cooking,
earnest appeals have been made to me to plan my
next book for the especial benefit of those who have
just begun, or who are about to begin, to keep house
for two or three. The young wives want to know how
to buy supplies for a small family; how to cook economically
and well; what to do with food that is left
over from any meal; and numerous other things pertaining
to their daily work. At last I have set about
telling them. They will find that it is not necessary
to have an immense income in order to live well.
Strict adherence to careful instructions will, with a
little good sense thrown in, enable a young housekeeper
to accomplish wonders. She can practise
economy and at the same time have a table that is
attractively and wholesomely spread,—something for
which most housekeepers strive without knowing the
best way to reach the goal. Of course, not all who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>begin to build a home are obliged to count every
dollar they expend. For the benefit of those who
can start in their married life with a servant to aid
them and money enough to indulge in luxuries, some
special information and advice are given. But, after
all, the aim has been particularly to lend a hand to
those whose incomes are moderate; to make the
book a simple one,—one that even a girl may take
interest in studying. If it prove of value to those
young women who are establishing homes for themselves,
its chief mission will be accomplished.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER I.<br /> <br />A WORD WITH THE YOUNG HOUSEWIFE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c005'>IF one were to get a hundred reputed good housekeepers
to come together and give their ideas of what constitutes
good housekeeping, no two would agree upon all
points. There are essentials which every one recognizes,
but there are many things which one housekeeper considers
of the greatest importance, whereas another may think the
same things of minor consequence or of no consequence
whatever. It is a sad fact that some good housekeepers
are not good home-makers. The young housekeeper should
bear in mind that, while it is essential that the home should
be clean and orderly, and the food well cooked and regularly
served, this does not make the home. One can get
all these comforts in a well conducted hotel or boarding-house,
but the man or woman is to be pitied who has no
higher ideal of a home than what is furnished by a hotel
or boarding-house, no matter how sumptuous. A selfish
woman can make a good housekeeper, so far as the keeping
of the house in perfect running order is concerned, but
it is difficult for a selfish or lazy woman to make a home.
A young woman who would create an ideal home must possess
some judgment, and a heart in which charity and sympathy
have a large place.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>My idea of good housekeeping is where a woman keeps
her home sweet and orderly; provides simple, well cooked
food; makes her home so restful and cheerful that all who
come into it shall be better for breathing the atmosphere
of kindness and cheerfulness that pervades the place; and
where the household machinery always runs smoothly because
of the constant thoughtfulness of the mistress of the house.
A place like this is truly a home, and the woman at the head
of it deserves the respect and admiration of everybody. I
have seen such homes among the rich and among the poor,
for neither wealth nor poverty prevents the right person
from filling with the atmosphere of comfort and happiness
the house of which she is the mistress.</p>

<p class='c009'>A housekeeper’s duties are many, and, to one nervous
and fretful, they are exhausting. What seems to the woman
of good digestion and steady nerves a mere trifle, to be
laughed at and forgotten, may appear to the delicate, nervous
woman a calamity to be wept over. Much of the irritability
from which women suffer is due to their expectation
of too much of themselves and others. If women would be
reconciled to the inevitable, they might make everybody
about them much happier. A choice bit of china may be
broken. Is it worth the while to make the whole household
miserable for what cannot be helped? A dish may be
spoiled in the cooking. It will not help your digestion or
that of the family to fret over it. You may be naturally very
orderly, but some members of the family may not. Will it
pay to make them and yourself uncomfortable by worrying
over the matter? If your servant or any other member of
the household should not come up to your standard, throw
the mantle of charity over the faults that you cannot remedy,
and pray that others may be equally charitable to you.</p>

<p class='c009'>The good housekeeper will certainly look well to the ways
of her household, but her eyes will be those of the kind, just
woman. She will not look for miracles; she will not expect
to get the best supplies and service when paying only the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>lowest price; she will not hope to make something out of
nothing; she will be brave enough to live within her means,
even if they be small; she will not be afraid to do her work
honestly and well; and, finally, she will be so true to herself
at all times, and so adjust and simplify her domestic duties
that she will not exhaust body and mind in trying to do two
persons’ work for the sake of “keeping up appearances.”
How many families lose all the comforts of home life in this
senseless effort! If you stop to consider what this “keeping
up appearances” means it puts the people in a very
unenviable light, for it simply means that people want to
give you a false impression of their possessions. No member
of the family is so much injured by this deceptive life as
the housekeeper. All her power of body and mind is bent
to the task of making the best possible appearance with the
smallest amount of expenditure. Intellect is cramped in
the battle and all repose is gone from home life. No matter
how good the housekeeping, the spirit of the home-maker
is not there. No young woman has a right to dwarf
her life for such a purpose. Let her make the most of the
means at her command, but let her never sacrifice her physical,
moral, and mental well-being to a desire to make a
display disproportionate to her circumstances, for that is
not good housekeeping.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <br />ABOUT FURNISHING THE HOUSE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c005'>IN these days of lavish ornamentation and bric-à-brac, the
young housekeeper must be on guard against filling her
house with such furnishings as would make it stuffy and
cause it to lack individuality. The home should be an
index to the character of the family. Do not furnish your
house fully until you have lived in it a while. Buy at first
only such furniture as you need for comfort. When you
are settled you can study the needs of each part of the
house, and, after you have fully determined exactly what
you want, buy it whenever you see an advantageous
chance.</p>

<p class='c009'>Never decide hastily upon a piece of furniture; purchase
for the future as much as for the present. It is
true fashions change in furniture from year to year, but it
is only people of large means who can follow a fashion of
this kind. The plain, elegant styles are quite expensive as
compared with the ordinary pieces which are turned out
of factories by the thousand, and which are covered with
ornamentation to catch the popular fancy. One quickly
wearies of such furniture; besides, it is not so well made
as the plainer styles, and therefore gets out of order very
easily.</p>

<p class='c009'>Get the things necessary for kitchen, bedroom, dining-room,
and sitting-room before doing anything about the
parlor, and let every article be of good quality, no matter
how plain. Make an estimate of what you can spend on
each room; then get the best things possible.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>What to Buy for the Chambers.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>One can get a chamber set for as low a sum as twenty-five
dollars; but the prices run up rapidly until the hundreds
are reached. Handsome, well made sets, with little or no
ornamentation (the quality of the wood, and the finish,
giving them a simple elegance not found in more showy
pieces) cost from forty to seventy-five dollars. The set
includes bedstead, dressing-case, wash-stand, towel-rack, a
small table, two common chairs, and a rocker. The more
expensive sets have the English wash-stand. No marble is
used with the finest chamber furniture. The springs, mattresses,
etc., must be purchased separately, as a rule. Have
good ones. Have shades and plain muslin curtains for the
windows. Stain the floors, if possible. If you prefer not
to do that, use straw matting, with one rug beside the bed
and another in front of the wash-stand. In buying the
toilet set select one that has a plain, fine shape and simple
decoration.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Dining-room Furniture.</h3>

<p class='c011'>There are two articles which one must have for this
room: a table and some chairs. It often happens that the
young housekeeper, not realizing the necessity for having
these of generous size, and well made, chooses articles that
appear good, but which, in a short time, become unstable.
Oak is the most satisfactory wood for the dining-room.
Have the table of good width, as a narrow one never looks
well. The chairs should be strong, broad-seated, and with
high backs.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having the chairs and table, you can wait for the other
things, although a sideboard table is a desirable thing, if
one can afford it. If you cannot have exactly what you
want, be patient. Sideboards, sideboard tables, and china
closets of glass all come in such simple yet tasteful designs
that one may be sure to like them all one’s life. It will pay
to wait for such a piece of furniture. Have a hard-wood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>floor, if you can; otherwise have the floor stained. Just
enough of the floor may be stained to make a deep border,
and a simple rug be placed in the centre of the room.
Shades, without any draperies, answer very well for this
room.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Comfort in the Sitting-room.</h3>

<p class='c011'>In the sitting-room, where the family gathers for the
evening, and where some members of the household spend
a good part of each day, put all the comfort you can. Let
it be one of the largest and brightest rooms in the house.
There should be a bookcase, a firm table of good size,
several comfortable chairs, a couch with plenty of pillows, a
good lamp, with a shade that will not try the eyes, some
pictures, a few plants and shades and draperies that will
soften, but not exclude, the light. If possible, have an open
fireplace. Let this be a room that shall always be remembered
as one of the pleasantest spots in the world. When
possible, have a hard-wood or a stained floor, with a rug in
the centre.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Selecting Carpets and Rugs.</h3>

<p class='c011'>In buying carpets remember that the best are always the
cheapest. The more limited one’s means are, the more
essential it is that only a good article shall be purchased.
The best quality of body Brussels will outwear two or more
of the cheaper tapestry carpets. A finely woven smooth
ingrain carpet may cost half a dollar more per yard than
one of common texture, but it will be cheaper in the
end. Nothing is more unsatisfactory than one of the
loosely woven straw mattings. A fine matting, costing say
from sixty to seventy cents a yard, will last a dozen years or
more, with constant wear, too. It is so fine that but little
dust sifts through, and the strands do not pull apart, as
in coarser grades. Rugs for the centre of the room can
be made from a body Brussels, with a border to match.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>They should be tacked down. Japanese cotton rugs, pretty
and durable, cost from three to six dollars. They are
good for bedrooms, bath-rooms, and sitting-rooms. Buy
handsome rugs whenever you can afford to. They are
a good investment; for, unlike carpets, they do not wear
out, and you can hand them down in the family the same
as silver or diamonds. A beautiful Oriental rug is a joy forever.
In selecting one be particular to see that the colors
are rich, and have some brightness. In general, when
choosing carpets, have the groundwork rather light, and the
colors somewhat neutral. Such a carpet will always look
clean, and you will not feel the need of shutting out the
sunlight through fear of the carpet’s fading.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Choosing a Dinner and Tea Set.</h3>

<p class='c011'>To the young housekeeper of limited means the choice
of her table china is quite an important matter. One can
get sets for seven and eight dollars, but I should not advise
buying anything cheaper than a fifteen-dollar set. If a
decorated set be wanted, take one having soft tints, because
people soon get weary of seeing pronounced colors or
patterns.</p>

<p class='c009'>Very pretty English sets of one hundred and fifty pieces,
decorated in blue, may be had for fifteen dollars. Minton
sets of one hundred and thirty-six pieces, basket-pattern
border, and decorated in a fine shade of blue, are offered as
low as twenty-five dollars.</p>

<p class='c009'>American china sets in colored decorations are sold at
about the same price as the English. Plain white French
china sets of one hundred and thirty pieces cost about
thirty-five dollars. The quality and prices rise rapidly until
sets costing hundreds of dollars are reached.</p>

<p class='c009'>In making a choice from the great variety displayed there
are several things to consider. For instance, what price
can you afford to pay? Is the style one that will be lasting,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>and are the goods durable? It often happens that the
decoration of a cheap set is much daintier than that of
some of the more expensive kinds.</p>

<p class='c009'>The English and American wares are thick, and do not
chip or break easily; but when they do chip, the broken
part soon becomes dark. The glaze on these wares cracks
readily when exposed to a high temperature. In a dinner
set one does not notice particularly that the ware is thick;
but thickness in the cups and saucers is disagreeably noticeable,
especially in the English wares. Then, too, unless one
get a “stock pattern,” it will often be difficult and expensive
to replace a broken piece. The dealers intend to carry a
pattern five years; after that one cannot feel sure of replacing
a broken piece without much delay and expense. Plain
white French china can always be replaced; the glaze does
not crack when exposed to a high temperature; if chipped,
the broken part does not become discolored; the ware is in
good shapes; the cups and saucers are delicate and pretty,
so that a full set of the china is desirable, which, to my
mind, is not the case with the English or American wares.</p>

<p class='c009'>In buying the French china it is wise to get plates with
rolled edges. It seems to me, all things considered, that
the French china is the most satisfactory, unless there is to
be rather rough handling, when I would advise the purchase
of the English or American productions. In that case I
would further advise that only a dinner set be bought, and
that something daintier be taken for the tea and breakfast
table.</p>

<p class='c009'>Odd cups and saucers are quite proper, and give variety
and brightness to the table. Odd dessert and salad plates,
also, are to be preferred to the regulation sets. The dessert
plates and cups and saucers that may be picked up here
and there in one’s travels are constant reminders of pleasant
experiences.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>Dainty Things for the Table.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Glass has largely taken the place of silver on some of
the most elegant tables, many housekeepers collecting and
prizing cut-glass as they would jewels; but the woman of
moderate means and good taste will find it possible to set
her table with plain, clear glass of dainty and elegant
shapes which will add brilliancy to the entire table service.
Water bottles, or carafes, as they are commonly called, are
much used, and are a great convenience. Individual salt-cellars
are again used instead of the salt-shakers which were
so popular for many years. These salt-cellars come in glass,
dainty china, and silver. A small silver salt-spoon is placed
by each one. The china and silver are by all odds the most
effective on the table. Pepper bottles of odd designs are
placed by the salt. Castors are not in favor.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bread-and-butter plates may be used at all meals, but
are particularly suited for breakfast, luncheon, and tea.
They are placed at the left of the regular plate. When
the butter and bread are passed, you put them on this
plate, dispensing with the small butter plate. These little
plates are a great help in keeping the table-cloth clean.
They come in several sizes and tasteful patterns.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Fashions in Cutlery.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Table cutlery, as the designation was formerly understood,
included all the knives and forks, nut-picks, etc.
To-day, among well-to-do people, all the forks, except that
which belongs to the carving set, are either sterling-silver
or silver-plated. It is astonishing how the table appliances
have multiplied in this luxurious age. For the fish course
there are sterling-silver knives and forks of special shapes,
and a broad silver knife and fork for serving the fish.
Oyster forks of another shape are considered indispensable
when raw oysters are served. Knives and forks of medium
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>size are used for entrées, the forks being silver and the
knives having silver, silver-plated, or steel blades. For the
meat course the forks are silver and the blades of the knives
steel. The dessert knives and forks are silver-plated; the
butter knives that are placed by the little bread-and-butter
plates are silver. So it will be seen that the cutlery of
to-day does not mean for fine tables what it did formerly.
Common knives and forks are made with flat tangs, to
which pieces of wood or bone are joined for the handle.
In fine knives the tang is made round, and is pressed into
a round groove made in the handle. Sometimes this is
fastened with a rivet, sometimes with a spring, and again
with some cement.</p>

<p class='c009'>The handles of the finest knives are weighted, unless
made of a heavy material like silver. This is important,
as it causes the knife to lie flat upon the table. Handles
are made of sterling silver, mother-of-pearl, ivory, grained
celluloid, plain celluloid, etc. Buckhorn and imitations
of buckhorn are used a great deal for carving sets. Ivory
has been used the most for the best class of knives and
forks, but in furnace-heated houses the ivory is apt to
split. Even the greatest care does not insure against it,
and dealers find that this often happens while the goods
are kept in their stores. As a substitute for ivory, celluloid,
grained celluloid, and ivorine are coming into use.
These substances neither crack, stain, nor turn yellow, as
does the ivory; which, of course, is a great consideration.
Mother-of-pearl handles cost about twice as much as ivory.
With proper care one can keep them in good condition
through a lifetime. Sterling-silver handles are very handsome
and satisfactory. Knives and forks with metal handles,
which are plated with the rest of the knife or fork, are the
most commonly used, because they are so easily cared for
and are not liable to get out of order. They are, however,
not found upon elegant tables.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>WHAT IS NEEDED IN THE KITCHEN.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The kitchen is so important a part of the home that the
furnishing should be such as to make the work there both
easy and successful. The following list may aid the young
housekeeper when making her purchases. The woman
with a limited purse may find that she will have to strike
out many things from the list, while the woman with a large
house and money in plenty will probably extend it.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>The Range.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Upon no one article of household furniture do the comfort
and well-being of the family depend so much as upon
the kitchen range or stove. A poor range will spoil not
only food, but also good temper and happiness; whereas
the right sort of range, well treated, will be a source of the
greatest comfort and economy. No matter what else you
feel you must economize in, do not let it be in buying the
kitchen range. Some ranges have reached such a degree
of perfection that it is hard to see where they can be improved.
The plainer the range the easier it will be to keep
it clean, and of course the cost will be less than if it be
trimmed very much. Before making a choice, examine
every part thoroughly. Always try to get one that has a
large oven in proportion to the size of the range. There
should be plenty of dampers that can be used to hasten the
fire or to check it, so that it will keep twelve hours, if necessary.
Ranges are made that will do this. Learn all the
characteristics of your range, and treat it well; then it will
be an invaluable friend to you.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the kitchen, as in every other part of the house, it
is economy to furnish with good articles. Poor cooking
utensils are never cheap. In buying iron utensils, be sure
to get those that are thoroughly finished. The steel goods
come higher than the cast-iron, but they are so smooth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>that they are four times as valuable in the kitchen as the
rougher makes.</p>

<p class='c009'>The granite or agate ware lightens the labors in the
kitchen wonderfully. It is, however, very expensive, and
is not so well made as formerly. When buying this ware,
examine it closely to see that there is no defect in the
enamel. A careful housekeeper who does her own work
will find this ware a great comfort, it is so light, smooth, and
clean; and with good treatment it will last well.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mixing-bowls come in yellow and white ware. The white
is stone china, and is more durable than the yellow; and
although it costs more than the latter, it is cheaper in the
end. A steamer of medium size is one of the most useful
utensils. If it be light and simple, it will be used frequently
for making puddings and for warming over food, etc. The
cheapest kind is made of tin, and in two parts, the lower
part being a deep saucepan, into which the water is put,
and the upper part a round pan with a perforated bottom.
Be particular to see that the cover and all other parts fit
well.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here is a list of articles with which all kitchens should be
supplied:—</p>

<h3 class='c012'>FURNISHING THE LINEN CLOSET.</h3>

<p class='c011'>In olden times the bride came to her new home with
a generous supply of linen, the greater part of which was
spun and woven by her own hands; in many cases, indeed,
the flax was raised and prepared for the spinning-wheel by
her. In some parts of Europe this custom still exists. The
bride of to-day takes great pains and pride in providing
her household linen, many months being given to dainty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>sewing and embroidery. Each article has stitched into it
many bright hopes and day dreams. Nothing else in the
furnishing of the home has blended with it so many tender,
loving thoughts, and to the woman of sentiment it is more
sacred than almost any other household possession. Once
acquired, this love for fine household linen will cling to a
woman all her life. Indeed, what material thing can she
bring to her new home that will give more pleasure than a
generous supply for her linen closet?</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Imported Linens.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Irish, French, Scotch and English table linens cover many
grades, from the coarsest to the finest weaving and the most
elaborate patterns. All the new designs are large, but in
some of the choicest damasks it is possible to get small
patterns, if they be preferred. The damask sold by the
yard rarely reaches a higher price than two dollars and a
half. If one wish for especially pleasing designs and extremely
fine quality, it will be necessary to buy the set,—table-cloth
and one dozen napkins. The usual width of the
best table damask is two yards and a half, but it may be
three yards in width. The cloths come from two and a
half to four yards in length. In these handsome cloths the
border is deep, and the centre frequently perfectly plain.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Table-cloths and Napkins.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The range in quality and price of table linen is greater
than that of almost any other fabric. It is a long step from
the materials that are so coarse, so loosely woven that they
might be used for sieves, to the double damask, so fine that
even under a magnifying glass it is almost impossible to
discern the threads. One can buy three or four yards of
the coarse fabric for about a dollar, and it is possible to be
asked one hundred times as much for a dozen napkins and
a table-cloth, three or four yards long, of the finer quality.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>But the average housekeeper does not go to these extremes.
It does, however, often happen that a woman with a limited
purse, and a thousand calls upon it, makes the mistake of
buying table linen of too inferior a grade. It is not economy
to purchase a mixture of cotton and linen. Better a coarse
all-linen table cloth than a fine one with part cotton, which
may look attractive in the store, but cannot be laundered
well, whereas the pure linen will improve with age and wear.
In purchasing table linen the questions that the housekeeper
should ask herself are: Will it be subject to hard wear, and
be laundered by inexperienced hands? Can I afford to
replenish it frequently? Shall it be fine and beautiful, or
shall it be durable, with as much beauty as possible under
the circumstances?</p>

<p class='c009'>The finest goods are of Irish and French manufacture; but
the German, while coarse, wear wonderfully well, and some
of them have very handsome designs. Nothing in the way
of linen lasts longer than the half-bleached damask, and if
one live in the country, this may be bleached to a snowy
whiteness in a few months. In purchasing these German
goods it is wise to get a cloth that costs at least one dollar
and a half or two dollars per yard. A cloth of this kind will
outwear several of the cheaper grades that are mixed with
cotton, and if properly laundered it will always look well.
Of course, one can get in these goods a fair piece of table
linen at seventy-five cents or a dollar per yard, but the better
quality will be found to be the cheaper in the end. Dinner,
luncheon, and tea sets may be had, the cloth costing no
more than if bought by the yard, with the advantage of
having a border all around it.</p>

<p class='c009'>A piece of heavy felt or double-faced Canton flannel will
be required under the table-cloth. It will cost about eighty
cents a yard. It is a good plan to get one that will answer
when the table is enlarged for guests. It can be folded
double when the table is small.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>Size and Quality of Napkins.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Fashion has decreed that a napkin shall not be put on
the table a second time until it has been washed. Few
housekeepers, however, have the means to provide themselves
with such a supply of napkins, not to speak of the
laundress to care for them; so the napkin ring is still a
necessity in the average household. It is important, however,
that the supply be large enough to admit of their
being changed two or three times a week. For general
use a dinner napkin is to be preferred, unless a separate
set of table-cloths and napkins be desired for breakfast.
In that case the napkins should be smaller than for dinner.
All napkins are finished with a plain hem, or are
hemstitched.</p>

<p class='c009'>Fringe is rarely used, except on fancy doilies. The
plain square napkin comes in all sizes, from twenty inches
to the size of the dinner napkins, which measure twenty-seven
inches; and the cost is anywhere from one dollar and
a half to fifty dollars a dozen. At five or six dollars a
dozen one can get napkins that are good enough for ordinary
use. The cheaper and smaller ones are unsatisfactory.
Whenever possible, the napkin should match the cloth.
One cloth will outwear two sets of napkins; therefore it is
well to get two dozen napkins to each cloth. One cannot
err in laying in a generous stock of plain ones, but the
style of the small fancy napkins is constantly changing, and
one should not buy too many of them at a time.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>A Word about Doilies.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Small square or round doilies are used a great deal
under finger bowls, Roman punch, and sherbet glasses.
These dainty bits of napery can be purchased in all the
stores where embroidery and materials for needlework are
sold; also in the linen stores. These doilies are either
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>hemstitched or fringed. The embroidery is usually in
washable silks, fine flowers or Dresden patterns being the
favorites. Doilies also come in Irish point, Mexican work,
and various kinds of lace. Larger doilies for bread, cake,
cheese, etc., are embroidered in white or colored silks,
with appropriate mottoes. Ladies who wish to do this
kind of work for themselves, or their friends, can send to
a stamping and embroidery store for a sample doily, and
the materials for a dozen or more. One should aim to get
as much variety as possible in color and design in the
dozen. A very fine linen is the material generally used.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the Oriental stores there can be found a small doily,
of a crêpe-like material, thickly embroidered with silk, or
silver and gold thread. They come with and without a
fringe, the fringed ones costing more than twice as much as
those without. I prefer those without the fringe for table
use. These doilies can be washed, but it must be with
great care. If the housekeeper will be careful to wash and
iron her doilies herself, they will always look fresh and
dainty. Make a strong suds with hot water and white
castile soap; wash the doilies in this, and rinse them in
several warm waters. Squeeze them very dry, and spread
them on a clean towel, and cover another towel over them.
Roll up tight and iron immediately.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Tea, Carving, and Tray Cloths.</h3>

<p class='c011'>For the small tables that are set for five o’clock teas and
card parties, etc., there are many pretty and inexpensive
cloths. Plain linen, with a plain or double row of hemstitching,
makes a satisfactory cloth. The cost is about
one dollar for a cloth measuring a yard square; plain
damask, with hemstitching, costs from one dollar and a
half to two dollars a square yard, and one dollar more for
a cloth measuring two square yards. Some long damask
cloths, with open-work borders and a fringe, cost four or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>five dollars. Small hemstitched cloths of linen and damask
come for carving cloths, tray cloths, and centre pieces.
They cost all the way from twenty-five cents upward.
These are useful in protecting the table, and they may be
made decorative by embroidery.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Sheets and Pillow Cases.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Sheets should always be of generous length and width;
never less than two yards and three quarters long, with the
breadth, of course, depending upon the width of the bed.
While linen sheets are desirable, they are not within the
means of all housekeepers of even fair incomes. Cotton
cloth makes a most satisfactory all-the-year-round sheet,
and a good quality can be purchased at from twenty-five
cents to seventy-five cents per yard, the cloth being from
two yards to two and a half wide. Indeed, one can buy
good sheets already made, two yards and a half wide, for
one dollar and a quarter or one dollar and a half apiece.
It is always more economical to buy the cloth and make
them at home, for two hems do not mean much work.
Unbleached sheeting may be made up, and bleached on the
grass. Buy unbleached cotton for servants’ sheets and pillow
cases, but do not make them too small. If the bed
linen be made of generous proportions it will protect the
bedding, and be more comfortable for the sleepers. Linen
sheets three yards long can be bought for from five to
fourteen dollars per pair. Pillow cases to match sell from
two to three dollars and a half per pair. The finest are
hemstitched.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Bed Spreads and Blankets.</h3>

<p class='c011'>For many years the honeycomb and Marseilles spreads
have been almost universally used. They are still sold in
large quantities, and will always be popular, for they need
only to be hemmed in order to be made ready for use.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>They do not rumple readily, they keep clean a long time,
and are, indeed, a most serviceable article. The Marseilles
quilts cost from two to fifteen dollars. Some come in
colors; but let no housekeeper be tempted by their beauty,
for she will find it a difficult matter to make them harmonize
with the other furnishings of her rooms. Dimity is
being used again. It costs from two dollars and a half to
four dollars and a half a spread. If one wish to make a
bolster scarf to go with the dimity, it will be necessary to
purchase a small spread and cut it in two. These spreads,
being dainty and easily washed, are in great favor.</p>

<p class='c009'>Materials for spreads come in all sorts of fabrics. Gobelin
cloth and what is called basket cloth, both soft, pretty
goods, are found two yards wide, and cost about one
dollar and a half a yard. These materials are made into
spreads and bolster scarfs; or, instead of the scarfs, a round
bolster may be covered with the material. These spreads
and scarfs are often embroidered in washable silks.</p>

<p class='c009'>Next to bed linen and towels in plenty, one of the essentials
for the health and comfort of the household is the stock
of blankets. Cotton batting comforters are cheap and warm,
but extremely debilitating to the sleeper; and since they
cannot be washed, they are uncleanly, as compared with
the woollen coverings. Use plenty of blankets instead,
and have them washed frequently. For people of limited
means, blankets that cost from five to six dollars a pair are
serviceable. People are buying more blankets that are made
of part wool and part cotton than of the all-wool patterns.
This is because they can be washed frequently without
shrinking. Select a smooth, soft blanket with white cotton
binding. The simpler the border the longer it will please
you. If possible, have a pair of summer blankets for each
bed. These cost from three to ten dollars a pair. They
can be washed as easily as a sheet, and are a source of the
greatest comfort in hot weather. As they will last the
greater part of a lifetime, get good ones. When blankets
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>are not in use they should be folded smoothly, pinned in
sheets, and placed on shelves in the linen closet.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Bath and Bedroom Towels.</h3>

<p class='c011'>In nothing relating to the supplies of her house does the
average housekeeper make so many errors as in the matter
of towels. It has not been wholly her fault in the past, but
it certainly will be in the time to come, if bright borders
and deep fringes decorate the towels with which she furnishes
her chambers and bath-rooms. As in the past, so it
is now: there is nothing so satisfactory for general use as the
huckaback towels. They are excellent for absorbing water,
and the slight friction is both pleasant and healthful. They
are now hemstitched, and cost from twenty-five cents to a
dollar and a half apiece, according to size and quality.
The goods can be bought by the yard if one prefer to make
her own towels. There are huckaback towels of fancy weaving,
which, hemstitched, cost from fifty cents to on dollar
and a quarter apiece. Some of these are fringed, at thirty-seven
and a half cents apiece. Damask towels, which are
really more for show than use, cost from twenty-five cents
to two dollars and a half. For the bath-room there are
really so many good things that it is a difficult matter to
choose. There always should be soft coarse towels that
will absorb water quickly, and at the same time cause a
slight friction. The towels also should be of generous size.
The huckaback is always good for drying off, but there
should be a good friction towel after this. Among the good
bath towels are crash towels, at twenty-five cents apiece.
Oxford towels, something like huckaback, but very large—26&nbsp;×&nbsp;50
inches—are one dollar apiece. Imperial bath towels,
of a peculiar style of weaving, absorbing water like a
sponge, cost a dollar apiece. Turkish towels make an excellent
friction towel, and are within the means of all. They
can be bought for even less than twenty-five cents; but I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>would not advise anything cheaper than twenty-five or fifty
cents, as a towel of this kind should be large. An article
which to me seems ideal as a friction towel is the kind
made of linen tape, which costs one dollar.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>For Kitchen and Pantry.</h3>

<p class='c011'>There should be a generous supply of kitchen and pantry
towels. Nothing is more satisfactory for glassware than the
plaid linen towels. These should be kept for silver, glass,
and fine china. Goods of this same character come in
stripes, and cost from twelve and a half to thirty-seven and
a half cents per yard. Fine Russian crash, when softened
by a little wear, makes the best kitchen dish towel. It
grows finer and whiter with each week’s use, whereas the
very coarse fabric really never softens. Every kitchen
should be supplied with half a dozen stove towels. Get
twilled brown cotton crash; cut it into yard-and-a-half
lengths and hem it. Keep but two of these towels in the
kitchen, and have one washed each day. They are to use
in handling the pots and pans about the stove and oven.
There should be a generous allowance of crash towels in
the kitchen, as every utensil should be carefully wiped with
one that is clean and dry.</p>

<p class='c009'>The hand towels in the kitchen should be soft and
smooth. Frequent wiping on the rough Russian crash will
soon make the hands red and rough, as this hard fabric
scratches and does not wipe dry. A twilled crash of cotton
and linen, which may be bought from twelve and a half to
fifteen cents a yard, makes satisfactory hand towels. There
are many varieties.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <br />DIVISION OF THE HOUSEHOLD WORK.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c005'>It is a perplexing task for young housekeepers to divide
properly the weekly work of the household. Even when
I start to write on the subject, many difficulties present
themselves, as no two houses are conducted on exactly the
same plan. What would be the right thing for one home
would be entirely impracticable in another. The woman
who does her own work, or keeps but one servant, must, of
course, plan her work quite differently from the woman who
keeps two or more servants. Then, too, the place and
mode of living will influence the arrangement of household
work. For example, in the country the style of living is
much simpler than in the city; the hours are more regular,
there are fewer stairs to go over, less dirt and dust accumulate,
and, in short, practically all the work is done on two
floors. This makes the duties of mistress and maid lighter
than in the city house. The pure air, quiet surroundings,
and long, uninterrupted hours make it possible for a woman
to accomplish a great deal of housework in a day, and yet
have leisure for reading, sewing, and quiet thinking.</p>

<p class='c009'>But, on the other hand, the city housekeeper has her
advantages, such as the house fitted with all modern conveniences;
stores and markets close at hand; and, if extra
or heavy work is to be done, easy means of getting men
and women to do it. The changing scenes in the city
take woman out of herself and the narrowing cares of home
life, and keep her interested and in touch with the world,
thus making her duties less irksome than they might be in
a regular and monotonous life.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Yet, no matter where one resides, there are certain daily
duties that must be attended to if people would live decently
and in order. I will try to map out programmes of
these duties, so that the inexperienced housekeeper will be
able to outline her daily work by them. It is not to be
expected that these programmes will be followed exactly;
they are simply suggestions which each housekeeper may
adapt to the exigencies of her own household.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Every-day Duties.</h3>

<p class='c011'>As there are many routine duties that must be performed
every day, I will treat of them here. Special work
will have a day assigned to it. It is almost appalling to
look at the list of daily duties of the household, when one
remembers that it frequently happens that there is but one
pair of hands to do all the work; yet there are thousands
of women who are well and happy in passing their lives
that way, knowing that they contribute to the health and
comfort of their families. If there be system in doing the
work, the burden will be materially lightened. Each member
of the family has his or her duties. Habits of order
and punctuality should be cultivated. Being late at meals
and leaving things out of place will increase the burdens of
the housekeeper in a marked degree.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>What to do in the Morning.</h3>

<p class='c011'>First, make the kitchen fire; take up and sift the ashes.
After brushing all the dust from the range, wash off the
surface with a cloth and soap and water; then polish it
with stove blacking. Rinse out the teakettle, and after
the water has been running from the cold-water pipes for
about five minutes, fill the kettle and place it on the fire.
Sweep and dust the kitchen. Put the breakfast dishes on
to heat. Air the dining-room and set the table; then
prepare and serve the breakfast. Clear the breakfast table,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>assorting the dishes and freeing them from scraps of food.
Soak in cold water any dishes that are soiled with mush,
milk, or eggs; put the silver in a pitcher of warm water.</p>

<p class='c009'>Go up stairs and open the chamber windows, if they
were not opened the first thing in the morning. Take the
clothes from the beds, one piece at a time, and spread over
chairs or a low screen, so that the air shall pass through
them freely. Beat the pillows and bolsters, and place them
in a current of air. Turn the mattresses so that they shall
be aired on all sides. Leave the rooms to air for an hour,
or longer if possible.</p>

<p class='c009'>Return to the kitchen and wash the dishes; then put
them away at once. Wash the dish-towels in plenty of
soap and water, and rinse thoroughly; when possible, dry
them out of doors. Air, brush, and dust the dining-room;
then draw the shades. Make the beds, empty the slops,
and wash and wipe the bedroom toilet china. Put the
rooms in order and dust them. Next wash the basins and
the bath-tub, if necessary, and dust the bath-room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dust the halls and sitting-room, and any other rooms
that may require it. Collect the lamps and trim them.
Prepare the dinner or luncheon. If you live in the city,
the vestibule and sidewalk must be swept, and perhaps
washed. The earlier this work is done, the better, as there
will be less annoyance from frequent passers early in the
morning. If the home be in the country, the front and
back steps and the piazzas should be swept at the hour
most convenient for the housekeeper. In freezing weather
do not, of course, attempt to wash the piazza, steps, or
sidewalk, as the result would be an icy surface, dangerous
to limb and life.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Special Work for Special Days.</h3>

<p class='c011'>On Monday, as soon as the water is warm, put the
clothes to soak in strong suds. After the breakfast dishes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>have been washed, begin to wash the clothes. While one
boilerful is being scalded and a second batch of clothes
has been prepared for the boiler, put out the line. Now
put the scalded clothes in the rinsing water. Take nearly
all the hot suds from the boiler, and replace with clean
cold water, putting the second batch of clothes to scald
in this. Rinse the first lot and put on the lines to dry;
continue the work until everything except the flannels and
colored articles have been washed. While the coarse
towels are being scalded, wash and hang out the flannels;
next wash the colored things. When all the clothes have
been hung out, empty the boiler and wash and wipe it until
perfectly dry; also clean the laundry. Now take a luncheon.
Do the chamber-work, and then prepare the family
luncheon or dinner. The brushing up and dusting must be
omitted to-day. After the noonday meal, wash the dishes
and clean up the kitchen. Bathe, and change your clothes;
and after resting, take the clothes from the lines and
sprinkle and fold them. Flannels must be taken in while
they are still slightly damp. Iron the flannels, and after
that prepare the evening meal. In the short winter days
it will be best to wash the flannels and colored clothes
before the white articles, as the more rapidly a woollen or
colored fabric dries the better it will look.</p>

<p class='c009'>On Tuesday, directly after the breakfast dishes have
been washed and the dining-room put in order, begin ironing,
starting with the plain pieces, such as sheets and
pillow-cases. As soon as the irons work smoothly, iron the
starched clothes. In about two or three hours the fire
must be replenished. When this is done, and while it is
burning up, do the chamber work. If all the ironing cannot
be done in the forenoon, finish it, if you can, in the
afternoon. The meals for washing and ironing days should
be as simple as possible.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>Where one Servant is Kept.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>If there be one servant in the house, the mistress can
make these two days less burdensome, if she herself will
wash the breakfast dishes, put the dining-room in order, and
make the beds. If there be children in the family, they can
be taught to do the lighter work. In suggesting that the
chamber work be left until the fire is renewed, it is supposed
that hard coal is used. If wood or soft coal be used, the
fire will have to be replenished frequently; and since these
substances burn much more readily, the time for chamber
work will be limited unless the draughts be closed. Wednesday
is often taken by housekeepers for a sort of off day; but
if, as is the case in many Eastern towns, Thursday be the
servant’s day out, it will be better to sweep on Wednesday,
and have the lighter work done on Thursday. Once in two
weeks should be often enough for a thorough cleaning of
most of the rooms in a well regulated house. A room properly
cleaned will be in a better sanitary condition at the end
of two weeks than one that is only half cleaned every week.
If the floors be of natural wood, or be stained or painted,
the dust and lint must be wiped off with a dry cloth every
few days, but if the floors be carpeted the thorough sweeping
once in two weeks should be sufficient, except in a
sitting-room or dining-room. I will give the method of
cleaning a room properly. These directions, slightly modified,
apply to all rooms.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Cleaning a Room by System.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Remove the draperies, and dust and remove all small
articles. Dust all the furniture, removing the lighter articles
and covering the heavy pieces; dust and cover the pictures.
Brush the walls and ceilings, being careful to remove all dust
from the tops of the doors and windows. Brush all dust
from the window frames, ledges, and blinds. If there be
rugs on a bare floor, roll them up and put them out of doors
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>to be beaten and aired; then sweep the floor with a soft
brush. After all the dusting and washing of windows has
been finished, rub the floor with a soft, dry cloth. If it be
a stained or painted floor, wipe it a second time with a cloth
slightly dampened with kerosene; or if it be polished, do
the polishing at this time. If the room be carpeted, sweep
it with a clean broom; if the carpet be very dusty, sprinkle
over it, before sweeping, corn meal or sawdust, slightly
dampened; or, if it be more convenient, take dry salt.
Let the dust settle, then sweep the carpet a second time.
Now dust the room, wash the windows, and remove the
covers from the furniture and pictures. After this has been
done, put two gallons of tepid water in a pail with four tablespoonfuls
of household ammonia. Wring a cloth out of
this and wipe the carpet, rubbing hard to remove any dust.
Beat the rugs by spreading them face down on clean grass
or a smooth board and beating with a switch or rattan
beater. If it be impossible to lay them flat, hang them on
a line and beat them. Place them on the floors, and put
the furniture, ornaments, and draperies in place. Clean
one or more rooms in this manner on Wednesday morning.
Prepare the noonday meal, and after this has been served,
and the dining-room and kitchen put in order, rest until it
is time to attend to the evening meal.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>The Last Half of the Week.</h3>

<p class='c011'>On Thursday, after the regular work is done, the morning
should be devoted to various odd tasks, such as cleaning
the refrigerator, and inspecting and cleaning the cellar.
See that no decaying vegetation, damp paper, etc., is
there. Wash the cellar stairs. Next clean the kitchen
and prepare something for the evening meal; then serve
the noonday meal.</p>

<p class='c009'>The remainder of the weekly sweeping should be done
on Friday morning. Every two weeks the silver should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>cleaned in the afternoon. Many housekeepers clean silver
every week, but if it be properly washed and wiped each
day this will be unnecessary.</p>

<p class='c009'>As there must be some extra cooking done on Saturday
for Sunday, plan for that on Friday, making all the arrangements
possible, so that this work may be done early Saturday
morning, while the fire is at its best. All the materials
for cooking should be in the house on Friday afternoon or
early Saturday morning. If fruits are to be prepared for
the next day’s baking, get them ready some time on Friday.
Saturday is usually a busy day. Extra cooking and cleaning
must be done, that the work on Sunday may be light.
Many housekeepers change the beds on Saturday, rather
than on Sunday. If this be the practice, when the rooms
are put to air, remove the soiled linen and spread out the
fresh, that it may be well aired. If possible, rise early
enough to clean the steps, piazza, and sidewalk before
breakfast. As soon as the regular morning work is done,
attend to the extra cooking. When this is finished, clean
the kitchen and its closets, the china closets, and the back
hall.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>A Day of Rest.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Plan to have as little work as possible to do on Sunday,
but do not fall into the error of wearing yourself out on
Saturday and making all the family uncomfortable on Sunday,
simply because you would not break the Sabbath. The
woman who manages to keep her family comfortable and
happy on this day, even if it be necessary to do a little extra
work to attain that end, will have a better moral and
spiritual influence than she who makes all the members
dread the day as being one of the most uncomfortable in
the whole week at home. In most families on this day the
breakfast is late and the dinner served about two o’clock,
the supper being light and informal. While there are many
housekeepers who still cling to the old custom of having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>cold dinners, the majority have a hot one, as it often happens
that this is the only meal throughout the week at
which the whole family is sure to meet.</p>

<p class='c009'>If but one servant be kept, she ought not to be required
to perform any duties after the dinner dishes have been
washed and put away. The remainder of the day and
evening should belong to her. If there be no servant, the
housekeeper surely is entitled to what little rest she can
get after dinner, and the other members of the family should
find it a pleasure to prepare whatever light refreshments
may be required in the evening. Remember that there are
heavy duties for Monday morning, and do not leave a lot
of dishes in disorder to add to these burdens.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Two or More Servants in a Family.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The round of duties for the week having been thus outlined,
I wish to make a few suggestions to the woman who
keeps two or more servants. The duties must be so divided
that each shall bear her proper proportion of the work. In
the case where there are several servants, there is greater
ceremony in the mode of living. Suppose there be two
servants, and the family be fairly large. The second girl
must do all the upstairs work, take care of the parlors, halls,
dining-room, china closet, etc. It will be her duty to care
for the silver, glass, and fine china. Every evening, after
the dining-room work is finished, she will go to the chambers,
empty all slops, refill the water pitchers, turn back the
bed clothes, and lay the night garments on the bed. She
will draw the shades and see that there is a stock of matches,
towels, etc. In the morning she will attend to the dining-room,
put the breakfast dishes on to heat, dust the lower
halls and parlors, and sweep the steps and sidewalk. The
cook will care for all the lower part of the house, her own
room, the cellar, and the back steps and stoop. The washing
and ironing must be divided between them. It is usual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>to have the cook do the plain washing and ironing, while
the second girl takes the starched clothes. If, however,
the second girl be required to do plain sewing, the cook
does the heavier part of the washing.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the matter of the duties of a servant each housekeeper
must make her own laws, but the more servants there are,
the more clearly must each one’s responsibility be defined,
and the mistress will save herself an immense amount of
annoyance if she will take pains to divide the work of the
household with good judgment and with justice, not allowing
any dictation in the matter. She should not be hasty
in reaching a conclusion, but should be firm in her decisions.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <br />SOME THINGS TO BE LEARNED EARLY.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c010'>Proper Management of Fires.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c011'>ONE of the first things a young housekeeper must master
is the science of managing fires. Now, a coal
fire is like some people: it will stand a certain amount of
nagging, pressure, and neglect, but it will make you suffer
in some way for all your abuse. On the other hand, with
uniformly fair treatment, it will repay a hundred-fold in
comfort.</p>

<p class='c009'>The demands upon the kitchen fire are varied. Sometimes
we want a very hot oven or surface, and again we
must have only a moderate amount of heat. The degrees
of heat must be regulated by the various checks and
draughts in the range, rather than by the use of a greater
or less amount of coal. In the morning remove all the
ashes and cinders. Put the shavings or paper on the grate
loosely, and then put in the kindling wood, crossing the
pieces, that there may be a free circulation of air. Open all
the draughts and light the fire. As soon as the wood begins
to burn, put on some coal. Let the fire burn for ten minutes;
then shut all the dampers, but keep open the draught
in front of the fire. When the coal begins to burn well, add
enough fresh fuel to come nearly to the top of the lining of
the fire-box. Keep the front draught open until all the coal
has become ignited, but not until it becomes red-hot. Now
close the front draughts, and the fire will be hot enough for
anything you may want to do for hours to come. Should
you want only a moderate heat, there are checks with all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>modern ranges which enable you to make the combustion
very slow. If greater heat be wanted, open the draughts,
and in ten minutes you will have a glowing fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>These are the great secrets of always having a good fire
when you want it: Do not let the coal burn to a white
heat; when you do not require a hot fire, open all the
checks; when you want a hot fire, close the checks and
open the draughts; and, of course, the moment there is
no further need of a hot fire, close the draughts and open
the checks again. A fire built and managed in this manner
can be used constantly for four or five hours.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Points about the Furnace Fire.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The furnace fire should be shaken down and raked perfectly
clear in the morning. A few shovelfuls of coal should
be put on, and all the draughts opened. The ashes should
then be taken up. As soon as the coal begins to burn well
and the fire looks clear at the bottom, put in enough coal to
come almost to the top of the fire-pot. Keep the draughts
open until all the gas has burned off; then close them, and
later, if the fire be too hot, open the checks. Except in
extremely cold weather, this is all the attention that ought
to be necessary through the day. The fire must be raked
down and fresh coal or cinders put on in the evening, but
a small amount of coal will answer for the night, unless the
draughts have been open the greater part of the day.</p>

<p class='c009'>On an extremely cold day it may be necessary to have
the draughts open a part of the time, and some coal put on
at noon.</p>

<p class='c009'>All the clinkers should be removed when the fire is raked
down in the morning. The water pan should be replenished
at least once a day. Some careless people leave the
ashes for a day at a time at the bottom of the furnace, where
they absorb the heat, robbing the house of its share.</p>

<p class='c009'>If the furnace fire be allowed to burn to a white heat it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>will be ruined for that day, unless more coal be put on a
little later. The cold-air boxes must admit enough air to
drive the hot air through the house, but not more than can
be heated.</p>

<p class='c009'>Heating stoves and open grates are to be managed as far
as possible the same as a furnace. With the stove there is
no trouble, there being plenty of checks and draughts. The
open grate is not so well provided.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Keeping the Refrigerator Sweet.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Few duties are more important than that of keeping the
refrigerator in perfect condition. If the lining be broken
in any part, so that the water soaks into the wood, attend
to the relining at once; or, if the refrigerator be not worth
that, discard it wholly. Never have the waste-pipe connected
with the plumbing in the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>Have the refrigerator placed where it can be flooded with
air and light whenever necessary, but, of course, in as cool a
place as possible. Once a week have everything removed
from it. Take out the shelves and wash them in hot soap-suds;
then pour boiling water over them. Place them in
the sun; or, if that fails, by the range, that they may be perfectly
dried. Now take out the ice rack and wash and scald
in the same way, except that, as there are grooves or wires
in this, the greatest care must be used to get out every particle
of dirt that may have lodged there. Next wash out
the ice compartment, running a flexible wire rod down the
waste-pipe, that nothing shall lodge there. Put two tablespoonfuls
of washing soda into a quart of boiling water and
set on the fire. When this boils, pour it into the ice compartment;
follow this with a kettleful of boiling water, and wipe
dry. Now wash the other parts of the refrigerator with hot
soap-suds, and wipe perfectly dry. Be careful to get the
doors and ledges clean and dry. Leave the refrigerator
open for an hour, and then return the ice and food to it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>Plan this work for a day when the iceman is due. The
work should be done immediately after breakfast, so that
the refrigerator shall be ready when the ice comes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Should you, after this care, still have trouble, do not use
the refrigerator. It will be far better to get along without the
comfort it affords than to endanger health and life by using
a contaminated article. Food never should be put in a
refrigerator while warm, because it absorbs the flavors of
other food and also heats the refrigerator.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Getting the Greatest Good out of Lamps.</h3>

<p class='c011'>In these days, when lamps are used so much, the care of
them is quite an important matter. If the lamps be good
and have proper attention, one cannot wish for a more satisfactory
light; but if badly cared for, they will be a source of
much discomfort. The great secret of having lamps in good
working order is to keep them clean and to use good oil.
Have a regular place and time for trimming the lamps.
Put a folded newspaper on the table, so that any stray bits
of burned wick and drops of oil may fall upon it. Wash
and wipe the chimneys and shades. Now take off all loose
parts of the burner, washing them in hot soap-suds and
wiping them with a clean soft cloth. Trim the wicks and
turn them quite low. With a soft, wet cloth, well soaped,
wipe the burner thoroughly, working the cloth as much as
possible inside the burner, to get off every particle of the
charred wick. Now fill the lamps within about one inch
of the top, and wipe with a damp towel and then a dry one.
Adjust all the parts and return them to their proper places.</p>

<p class='c009'>Whenever a new wick is required in a lamp, wash and
scald the burner before putting in the wick. With a student
lamp, the receptacle for waste oil, which is screwed on
the bottom of the burner, should be taken off at least once
a week and washed. Sometimes a wick will get very dark
and dirty before it is half consumed. It is not economy to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>try to burn it; replace it with a fresh one. The trouble and
expense are slight, and the increase in clearness and brilliancy
will repay the extra care. When a lamp is lighted,
it should not at once be turned up to the full height; wait
until the chimney is heated. Beautiful shades are often
cracked or broken by having the hot chimneys rest against
them. Now, when lighting a lamp be careful that the chimney
is set perfectly straight, and does not touch the shade
at any point. The shade should be put in place as soon as
the lamp is lighted, that it may heat gradually.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Take Good Care of the Plumbing.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The care of the plumbing is an important duty; yet,
provided there be nothing wrong about the plumbing at
the start, and the supply of water be constant and generous,
this duty will not be found a hard one. The housekeeper
should impress upon the younger members of her family
the importance of thoroughly flushing the water-closets.
She should at least once a day personally see to it that
there is sufficient flushing. The best time for this is after
the morning work is done.</p>

<p class='c009'>The laundry tubs should be thoroughly rinsed after washing.
Be free with the water, that no trace of suds shall
be left in the pipes.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the midday work is done, and again at night, the
pipe in the kitchen sink should be thoroughly flushed with
hot water, if possible. In case there be no hot water, be
generous with the cold. Once a week put half a pint of
washing soda in an old saucepan, and add six quarts of
hot water. Place on the fire until the soda is all dissolved;
then pour the water into the pipes, reserving two quarts of
it for the kitchen sink.</p>

<p class='c009'>Have an old funnel to use in the bath-tub and basins,
that the hot soda shall not touch any of the metal save that
in the pipes.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>Particles of grease sometimes lodge in the sink-pipe and
cause an unpleasant odor. The hot soda dissolves this
grease and carries it away.</p>

<p class='c009'>Copperas will remove odors from drain-pipes. Put one
pound of the crystals in a quart bottle and fill up with cold
water. Cork tightly and label, writing “Poison” on the
label. Pour a little of this into the pipes whenever there
is any odor.</p>

<p class='c009'>If thorough flushing and an occasional use of the hot
soda will not keep the pipes sweet, there is something
wrong with the plumbing, and it should be attended to at
once.</p>

<p class='c009'>It seems as if one need not caution people in regard to
throwing into either water-closet or basin anything that
may clog the pipes, but it is because of ignorance or carelessness
on the part of the people who use these conveniences
that much of the trouble with the pipes arises.
Here are some of the things that should never have a
chance to get into the pipes: hair, lint, pieces of rags, no
matter how small; matches, fruit peelings, etc.</p>

<p class='c009'>If for any reason there should be a bad odor from the
drain, two tablespoonfuls of carbolic acid, mixed with a
cupful of cold water and poured into the pipes, will prove
a good disinfectant. A small bottle of carbolic acid,
plainly labelled, always should be kept in the house, out
of the reach of the children.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>About the Bath-room.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The bath-room should have special attention daily, and
once a week a thorough cleaning. A woollen carpet is not
desirable for this room. The floor may be of tiles, or of
hard wood, stained or painted, or be covered with lignum
or oil-cloth. Of course, there must be a rug or two. The
Japanese cotton rug is cheap and pretty for this purpose;
or, one can make rugs from pieces of carpet.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Not only should the wash-basin be washed clean and the
bowl in the water-closet washed every day, but, if the bath-tub
has been used, this too should be washed and carefully
wiped dry. Dust the room, and hang the soiled towels
where they will dry before being put in the hamper provided
for such things.</p>

<p class='c009'>Once a week give the room a thorough cleaning. Wash
the toilet articles. Wash all the marble with soap and
water, and if there be any spots that are not easily removed,
put a little sand soap on the wash-cloth and rub the spot
well. The bowl in the water-closet should have a good
scrubbing with sand soap. Rub the bath-tub with whiting,
wet with household ammonia, and then wash it with plenty
of hot water and wipe dry.</p>

<p class='c009'>Never use for the bath-tub sand soap, or any substance
that would scratch, unless it be an enamel tub, in which
case no harm will be done. Clean the faucets with whiting.
Take a long-handled boot-buttoner and draw from
the waste-pipes all the bits of lint that have gathered there.
Dust the room and wash the floor, wiping very dry. Now
lay down the rugs, which already should have been well
beaten and aired.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Do not Neglect the Garbage Barrel.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The garbage barrel or tub should be thoroughly washed
once a week. In summer, after the barrel has been cleaned,
sprinkle into it one teaspoonful of carbolic acid mixed with
half a cupful of cold water. This will keep the barrel free
from offensive odors even in the hottest weather.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>WASHING DISHES.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Sort the dishes and scrape them free from fragments.
Have two pans, one for washing and the other for rinsing.
Have also a large tray on which to drain the dishes. Wash
the glassware first.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Proper Care of Glassware.</h3>

<p class='c011'>It must be remembered that even a scratch on the surface
of a piece of glass often will cause it to break at that
point under the slightest shock; therefore, it is essential that
it shall not come in contact with a sharp, hard substance.
A grain of sand on the bottom of the dishpan, or on the
cloth with which the article is washed or wiped, may be
the means of breaking a valuable dish. When possible, a
wooden or paper tub should be used in washing glass. A
soft silver-brush, soft cloths for washing, and soft linen
towels for wiping, also are necessary. Have the water cool
enough to bear the hand in comfortably. Make a strong
suds with hard soap. The second dish of water should be
of the same temperature. Wash each piece carefully, rubbing
with the soft cloth; then put in the rinsing water.
When four or five pieces have been washed, spread a coarse
towel on an old tray, and place the glass on this to drain.
Wipe the hands dry, and then wipe the pieces of glass with
a perfectly clean, dry towel. Rub gently, to polish. Hold
the glass up to the light, to see if it is perfectly clear, then
place on a clean tray. Always keep the towel between the
hands and the glass, and as soon as the towel becomes
damp change it for a dry one. The glass should not drain
long enough to become cold; for this reason it is best to
wash only a few pieces at a time. If the glass be cut, or an
imitation of cut, use the soft silver-brush to cleanse all the
grooves. As it is almost impossible to get the deeply cut
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>glass perfectly dry, it should not be placed at once on a
polished-wood surface. It is a good plan to have a soft
cloth on which to place cut pieces for ten or fifteen minutes
after they have been wiped. Glass that is ornamented with
gold must be treated with great care, to prevent the ornamentation
from wearing off. Use only castile soap, and do
not have the suds strong. Wash one piece at a time, and
wipe immediately.</p>

<p class='c009'>It will be seen by the foregoing that the care of glass can
be summed up in a few words: wash in clean warm suds
and wipe perfectly dry, using clean dry linen towels; be
careful not to scratch nor hit a piece of glass, and do not
expose the surface to sudden heat or cold.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Other Dishes and Utensils.</h3>

<p class='c011'>After the glass the silver should be washed and wiped.
Next wash the china in hot suds, and then rinse in the
second pan of hot water. Drain on the tray, and wipe
while yet warm. The kitchen crockery should follow the
china, then the tins, and finally the iron cooking dishes.
Change the dish-water often, having the first water very
soapy and the rinsing water hot. Be as careful to have
clean water and clean dry towels for the pots and kettles as
for the china, and wash in the same way as a piece of china,
having the outside as clean as the inside. Some kind of
sand soap or mineral soap is necessary to keep the tins,
granite-ware, and iron saucepans perfectly clean and bright.
After wiping such utensils with a dry towel, place them on
the hearth, to become perfectly dry, as they rust easily and
quickly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now rub the steel knives with either Bristol brick, wood
ashes, or sand soap. Wash them, and wipe perfectly dry.
Next wash the tray, the rinsing pan, the table, and the sink.
Finally wash the dish-towels, and then the dishpans.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>Some Special Cautions.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Pitchers, bowls, pans, and other utensils used for milk,
should have cold water stand in them for half an hour or
so, then be washed in plenty of clean soapy water. After
this they should be scalded with boiling water, wiped dry,
and placed in the sun and open air, if possible, for several
hours.</p>

<p class='c009'>Teapots, coffee-pots, chocolate-pots, and the like, should
be washed in hot soapy water and be rinsed in boiling water.
Use a wooden skewer to remove every particle of sediment
that may lodge in the spouts or creases of the pots. Wipe
perfectly dry, and expose to the sun and air, if possible, for
an hour or more.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pans in which fish or onions have been cooked, should
be washed and scalded; then they should be filled with
water, in which should be put a teaspoonful of soda for
every two quarts of water. Place them on top of the stove
for half an hour or more. This will insure the removal of
the flavor of fish or onions.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Care of Silver.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Silver that is properly washed and wiped every day will
require very little extra cleaning. Remove it from the table
on a tray and then put it into a wide-mouthed kitchen pitcher
containing warm water. When ready to wash it, have a pan
of hot soap-suds and a clean soft dish-cloth. Put all the
silver, except the knives, into the suds, and wash a few
pieces at a time, rubbing well with the cloth. Wipe the
silver, while it is still warm, with a fine soft silver-towel,
rubbing it until perfectly dry and bright. Always keep the
towel between the hands and the silver. As fast as a piece
is finished lay it on the tray, and when all the work is done
wipe the hands perfectly dry, and then put the silver away.</p>

<p class='c009'>Should there be any tarnish on any of the pieces, rub with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>a little wet whiting and a piece of chamois skin. Wash
again in the hot suds, and wipe.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the silver is to have a regular cleaning, put it in
a pan of hot suds and wash well. Spread several thicknesses
of paper on the table. Have at hand a saucer of
French whiting, finely powdered and sifted. Wet a little
of this with water, unless the silver is very much tarnished,
in which case use half water and half alcohol; or, instead
of the alcohol, half household ammonia. Rub the article
with this and then with dry whiting and a chamois skin,
finally using a soft silver-brush to clean out all the chasing
and creases. When all the silver has been cleaned in this
manner, wash it in clean hot suds, wipe on a towel kept for
silver, and put away.</p>

<p class='c009'>Do not put silver in woollen bags, as the sulphur in this
cloth tarnishes the metal. Rubber should not be placed
near silver.</p>

<p class='c009'>Only substances which are well known have been suggested
for the cleaning of the various articles of silver. There are
preparations in the market which many housekeepers use
because they consider them harmless, and great savers of
labor. Each one will decide for herself in these matters.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Do not Slight the Knife Blades.</h3>

<p class='c011'>In nearly all cases the blade of the knife requires different
treatment from the handle. If it be of unplated steel it must
be thoroughly polished every time it is used. If it be of
silver, or be silver-plated, a careful washing with soap and
water, and a thorough drying, will be all the daily care that
is required,—a thorough cleaning about once a week sufficing
to keep the blade perfectly clean. There should
be a knife-board for the steel knives. Boards covered with
leather that come for this purpose may be purchased at
any first-class kitchen furnishing store.</p>

<p class='c009'>To clean the knives have at hand a pan of clean, soapy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>water and a soft cloth. Hold the knives in the left hand
and wash the blades with the cloth, only wiping the handles
with the wet cloth, unless they be silver, in which case wash
them thoroughly with the soap-suds and cloth. Sprinkle the
board with some knife-polish. Hold the blade flat on the
board and rub back and forth until it is polished. If the
stain be hard to remove, dip a cork in the strong soap-suds,
then in the polishing powder, and, laying the blade of the
knife perfectly flat on the board, rub with the cork until the
stain disappears. Now wipe the polish off with a soft cloth
and rub the blade with a piece of chamois skin. The handles
of the knives should be protected while the blades are being
polished. Have a long, narrow bag of Canton flannel to
slip over the handle while the blade is being rubbed.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Rust and Other Annoyances.</h3>

<p class='c011'>If it should happen that the steel of knives or forks
becomes rusted, dip them in sweet oil and let them stand for
twenty-four hours, then rub them with powdered quicklime,
and the stain will be removed. If the handles of the knives
be ivory, and they become stained, rub them with whiting
and spirits of turpentine. This will remove all ordinary
stains. Still, the appearance of the ivory will be greatly
improved by a vigorous rubbing with the whiting and turpentine.
Frequent wettings with hot water and soap will
dull the mother-of-pearl handles, which should be wiped
with a damp cloth and rubbed dry with a soft towel. Silver
handles should be rubbed frequently with whiting. Celluloid,
ivorine, bone, etc., require the same general treatment
as ivory and pearl. The handles of knives, no matter what
the material, should never be allowed to stand in water.
The water, particularly if it be hot, loosens the handles from
the tang, and also dulls them. A tin or granite-ware pail or
pitcher should be kept exclusively for knives. When used,
it should have some water in it, but not enough to come up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>to the handle of the knife. As soon as the table is cleared
the knives should be put in this, to remain until the time
for washing them.</p>

<p class='c009'>If you have no regular case for the knives, they may be
kept in one made of Canton flannel. To make this take a
piece of flannel about three quarters of a yard wide and cut
off twenty-one inches. Fold over eleven and a half inches
of the selvage end, leaving a single thickness of about four
inches at the other end. Baste the doubled part together;
then stitch it into twelve compartments. Bind the bag with
tape, and sew tapes on the single flap at the centre. Of
course, the flannel is on the inside. When steel cutlery is
to be put away for any length of time, melt pure mutton suet,
and dip the steel part of the knives and forks in it. When
cool, wrap in tissue paper, and then in thicker paper or
Canton flannel.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <br />WORK ON WASHING DAY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c005'>ON washing day arrange the white clothes in this manner:
Half fill two tubs with warm suds. Put in one
tub the pieces soiled the most; put the remainder of the
articles in the second tub. Have a third tub half full of
warm water and the wash boiler half full of cold water.
Wash the cleaner clothes first, rubbing soap on the parts
which are soiled the most. Wring from this water and drop
into the tub of clean warm water. When all are done, rinse
the clothes well in the warm water; then wring out and soap
the parts that were badly soiled. Put these same pieces in
the boiler of cold water and set on the fire. Let the water
get almost boiling hot; then take up the clothes and put
them in a tubful of cold water. Rinse them from this into
another of warm water and from this into a third of bluing
water. Wring them as dry as possible; then shake them
out and hang on the lines. They should become perfectly
dry before they are folded. All the white clothing
should be washed in this manner. The second tubful can,
of course, be rubbed out and rinsed while the first is being
scalded. If clothes be not thoroughly rinsed and bluing be
used, the soap will combine with the bluing to give a yellow
tinge to the clothing. This is especially the case when liquid
bluing is used. A thorough rinsing is really one of the most
important steps in all the work.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Satines, Ginghams, and Prints.</h3>

<p class='c011'>These kinds of goods look better when no soap is used
and they are not starched in the usual way. For two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>dresses make one gallon of starch by mixing one cupful of
flour with one pint of cold water. Pour on this three quarts
and a half of boiling water. Pour half of this mixture into
a tub containing four gallons of warm water. Wash one of
the dresses in this, rubbing the fabric the same as if soap
were used. Now rinse in two clean waters and hang out to
dry. The starch cleans the fabric, and enough is held in
the cloth to make it about as stiff as when new. Wash the
second dress in the same way. This method is not for light
cambrics, but only for satines, ginghams, and dark prints.</p>

<p class='c009'>If the colors run, put half a cupful of salt in the second
rinsing water. If the color of the fabric be blue and faded,
put two tablespoonfuls of acetic acid, or twice as much vinegar,
into the last rinsing water. This will often restore the
color, but not always, as it depends upon the chemicals used
in the dyeing. The acid can be used in the last water in
which faded blue flannels are rinsed. Colored goods should
be dried thoroughly and dampened only a few hours before
you are ready to iron them. They should be ironed on the
wrong side.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>How Flannels should be Washed.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Have a tub half full of strong soap suds, in which has
been dissolved a tablespoonful of borax. Shake all the
dust and lint from the flannels, and then put them into the
suds. Wash them by rubbing with the hands and sopping
them up and down in the water. Wring them out of this
water and put them into a tub of clean hot water. Rinse
thoroughly in this water, then in a second tubful. Wring
dry, shake well, and hang on the lines. When nearly dry,
take them in and fold, rolling them very tightly. Wrap
a clean cloth around them, and, if possible, iron the same
day. Do not have the irons very hot, but press the flannels
well. Have clean suds for the colored flannels. To prevent
shrinking, the temperature of the water should be the
same in all the tubs.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>Never use yellow soap for washing flannel, and never rub
any other kind of soap upon the cloth.</p>

<p class='c009'>To wash blankets, make strong suds with some white
soap. To every three gallons of water add a tablespoonful
of powdered borax. Have the suds as hot as the hands will
bear comfortably. Shake the blankets, and, if the bindings
be of colored silk, rip them off. Put the blankets in the hot
suds and sop them up and down until the suds show that
the dirt has been removed. If there be any stains on the
blankets, rub the spots well between the hands, but remember
the caution not to rub soap on such goods. Have a tub
half full of clear water as hot as the suds. After squeezing
the suds from the blankets, put them in the rinsing water.
Sop them well in this, and then squeeze out the water;
finally rinse in a tub of bluing water, having the temperature
still as hot as the suds. Press all the water possible
from the blankets and hang them on the lines to dry, shaking
out all the wrinkles. When dry, fold smoothly and lay
on a clean board. Put another board on top, and on this
place some heavy weights. In a day or two the blankets
will be pressed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Wash only two blankets at a time, and select a clear day
for this work,—a windy day, if possible.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>The Right Way to Wash Silk Undergarments.</h3>

<p class='c011'>To three gallons of warm water add three tablespoonfuls
of household ammonia. Let the silk garments soak in this
for twenty minutes; then rub soap on the parts which are
the most badly soiled, and wash the articles with the hands.
Never rub them on a board. Rinse in two waters, wring
dry, and hang on the line. When nearly dry, take in and
fold, and, if possible, iron within a few hours. Never let
an iron come in contact with the silk; lay a piece of cloth
over the fabric, and iron on that.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ammonia may be omitted, and the silk garments be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>washed in strong suds made with white castile soap and
warm water.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>How to Launder Washable Curtains.</h3>

<p class='c011'>There are many inexpensive cotton or cotton and silk
fabrics used for curtains which launder very well if treated
properly. Shake out all the dust. Make weak suds with
white castile soap. Wash the curtains in this, and rinse
them in two waters; then wring dry. Next dip them in a
preparation made as follows: Soak half an ounce of isinglass
in one quart of cold water for an hour or more. Steep
one ounce of saffron on the fire in two quarts of hot water
for two hours. Stir the soaked isinglass and half an ounce
of alum into this, and then strain into a bowl. Put one
fourth of this mixture into another large bowl, and dip one
curtain into it, sopping it well, that the color and stiffening
may be equally distributed. Shake out and hang on the
line to dry.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the curtains are dry, sprinkle them, making them
very damp. Draw out evenly; then fold, and roll up in a
cloth; finally iron them, being careful to move the iron
lengthwise of the curtain, and to get the fabric very dry.</p>

<p class='c009'>The alum and saffron may be omitted, and the stiffening
be used for washable dresses or thin muslin curtains.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Cleaning Lace Curtains.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Lace curtains will not bear rubbing. All the work must
be done carefully and gently. For two pairs of curtains half
fill a large tub with warm water, and add to it half a pound
of soap, which has been shaved fine and dissolved in two
quarts of boiling water; add also about a gill of household
ammonia. Let the curtains soak in this over night. In the
morning sop them well in the water, and squeeze it all out;
but do not wring the curtains. Put them into another tub
of water, prepared with soap and ammonia, as on the night
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>before; sop them gently in this water, and then, after
squeezing out the water, put them in a tub of clean warm
water. Continue to rinse them in fresh tubs of water until
there is no trace of soap; next, rinse them in water containing
bluing. After pressing out all the water possible,
spread the curtains over sheets on the grass; or, if you have
no grass, put them on the clothes-line. When they are dry,
dip them in hot thick starch, and fasten them in the frame
that comes for this purpose. If you have no frame, fasten a
sheet on a mattress, and spread the curtains on this, pinning
them in such a manner that they shall be perfectly smooth
and have all the pattern of the border brought out. Place
in the sun to dry. If it be desired to have the curtains
a light écru shade, rinse them in weak coffee; and if you
want a dark shade, use strong coffee.</p>

<p class='c009'>If the curtains be dried on a mattress they must be folded
smoothly, the size of the mattress. Lace curtains can be
spread two or three thicknesses in the frame.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Points on Starching and Ironing.</h3>

<p class='c011'>In making and using starch have all the utensils and the
water perfectly clean. Mix the dry starch with cold water
enough to make a thin paste. Pour on this the required
amount of boiling water, stirring all the while. To each
quart of starch add a teaspoonful each of salt and lard. Boil
the starch until it looks clear, which will be in about ten
minutes. Strain it through a piece of cheese-cloth (it will
have to be squeezed through the cloth). White articles
should be dipped into the hot starch, but have it cooled
a little for colored articles. For collars, cuffs, shirts, etc.,
have the starch very thick; for white skirts it should be
rather thin; for dresses, aprons, and children’s clothing also,
the starch must be thin, and for table linen only the thinnest
kind imaginable should be used.</p>

<p class='c009'>Always have starched clothes thoroughly dried; then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>sprinkle evenly with enough cold water to make them very
damp. Fold smoothly and roll up in a clean cloth for
several hours. In ironing, begin with the plain pieces, like
the sheets and pillow cases. This will get the irons in condition
for the starched clothes, which should be done next;
and after these finish the plain pieces. Have the ironing
blanket and sheet spread smoothly on the table and tacked
in place, and have some fine salt spread on a board. Tie a
large piece of beeswax in a cloth, and after rubbing the hot
iron on the salt, rub the beeswax over it. Finally wipe the
iron on a clean cloth. This process will make the iron
clean and smooth. Starched clothes must be made very
damp; other articles should be dampened only slightly.
Starched clothes must be ironed until perfectly dry. In
ironing, do the rubbing lengthways when possible,—that
is, with the selvage.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>A Rule for Making Hard Soap.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>18 pounds of clarified grease.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>3 tablespoonfuls of powdered borax.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>3 pounds of potash.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>4 quarts of cold water.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Put the fat on the back part of the range, where it will
melt slowly. The potash is put into a large earthen or
stone bowl or jar. Upon this is poured three quarts of
cold water, and three tablespoonfuls of powdered borax is
added. This mixture is stirred with a wooden stick until
the potash is dissolved; then it stands until cold.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the fat is melted pour it into a butter tub. It must
not be hot when the potash is added; should it be, it must
stand until so cool that it will hardly run when poured.
When the potash mixture is perfectly cold pour it in a thin
stream into the fat, stirring all the while. When all has
been added, continue stirring for about ten minutes, when
the soap should begin to look thick and ropy. At this stage
pour it into a box, having it about three or four inches deep.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>Let it stand a few hours; then cut it into bars, and the bars
into pieces of a convenient length for handling. It will
still be soft, and should not be removed from the box for
at least two days. It will be hard and white.</p>

<p class='c009'>If you attempt to combine the fat and potash mixture
while the latter is at all warm it will take a long time to
make the soap, and the result will not be so satisfactory.
It is well to put paper under the soap tub and the bowl in
which the potash is prepared. Remember that potash is
very strong, and do not spatter it on yourself or on the floor.</p>

<p class='c009'>This is a hard soap,—a most desirable quality.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Borax Soap.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>2 pounds of good white soap.</div>
      <div class='line'>3 ounces of borax.</div>
      <div class='line'>2 quarts of water.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Shave the soap and put it in a porcelain kettle with the
water and borax. Place on the fire, and stir frequently until
the soap and borax are dissolved and combined. Pour the
hot mixture into a clean butter tub, and when cold, cover.
This soap is excellent for washing flannels, blankets, etc.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Soft Soap.</h3>

<p class='c011'>It is best to make the soap a few weeks before you wish
to use it, as it is rather hard on the hands when new.
Here is a good rule for making the soap without heating
the grease:—</p>

<p class='c009'>Put fourteen pounds of crude—not concentrated—potash
in a wooden pail and pour over it enough boiling water
to cover it. Stir well, and let the mixture stand over night.
In the morning pour this mixture into a large kettle and
place on the fire. Now add another pail of boiling water,
and stir frequently with a stick until all the potash is dissolved.
Next put ten quarts of soap grease in a water-tight
barrel and gradually pour in the hot potash. Stir until all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>the grease is united with the potash. Let this stand for
three hours; then add a pailful of hot water and stir well.
Add another pailful three hours later. After this add a
pailful each day for the next six days, stirring well with
a long stick each time. The soap should be stirred every
day for the next three weeks, when it will be ready for use.</p>

<p class='c009'>Be sure the potash is pure.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER VI.<br /> <br />IN THE DINING-ROOM.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c005'>ONE’S dining-room should be large enough to enable a
person to pass around the table comfortably when
the family or guests are all seated. It should also be light
and sunny, and easily heated and ventilated. The most
essential pieces of furniture are a table of generous width,
capable of being enlarged, comfortable chairs, and a sideboard.
After that, if the room be large enough and the
purse will admit of the purchase of a cabinet or two, with
glass fronts and sides, so much the better. In these there
can be kept dainty bits of china and glassware. These
cabinets will brighten a dining-room more than anything
else you can put into it, possibly excepting pictures. If
there be no room for a cabinet, a corner cupboard and some
hanging shelves will be a great addition. Pictures that suggest
pleasant things are, of course, always desirable. A few
thrifty ferns, flowering plants, or evergreens add a great deal
to the brightness and beauty of any room, but particularly
the dining-room. Have them there if you possibly can.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Setting the Table.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The table should stand in the middle of the room. Cover
it with a thick felt or a double-faced Canton flannel cloth.
Over this spread the white damask cloth, having the centre
fold come exactly in the centre of the table. Pass the hand
over the cloth to make it lie smooth. If there be a centrepiece,
carving, or tray cloths, or table mats, have them lie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>perfectly straight and smooth on the cloth. At each seat
place on the right the knives, spoons, and glasses; on the
left, the forks and napkins. Have the edge of the knife toward
the plate. Lay the forks with the tines up, and the
spoons with the bowls up. Have the spacing between the
seats regular, and the space between the knife and fork about
seven inches. Set the glasses at the points of the knives. If
individual salt-cellars and pepper bottles be used, they are
to be placed at the head of the plates; otherwise, place the
cellars and bottles at the corners of the table. The tablespoons
may be placed at the corners of the table, or near
the dishes where they will be required in serving. In the
centre of the table there may be set a dish of flowers or fruit.</p>

<p class='c009'>These general directions apply to the setting of the table
for any meal. Nearly all housekeepers have their own ideas
about the arrangement of the table, thus securing variety
and individuality.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Refinement not Exclusively for the Rich.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The incomes and style of living in this country have such
a wide range that it would be impossible to give here directions
for the table service which would meet the wants of
all classes. The woman of limited means who does her
own work could not serve her meals the same as one who
keeps one or more servants. As far as possible she will so
arrange her meals that it shall not be necessary to rise from
the table more than once or twice. Indeed, it is possible
to have everything on the table for breakfast, tea, or
luncheon, but at dinner time the meat, vegetables, and
soiled plates should be removed before the dessert is put
on. No woman, no matter how simply she lives, should get
into a slipshod way of serving her meals. The table can be
made, and should be, a means of refinement and pleasure.
Do not have it ceremonious, yet strive for neatness, brightness,
and order. No one has a right to mar the sociability
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>of a meal by bringing a gloomy countenance or disagreeable
subject to the table. When the housekeeper has
done all she can to make the meal suitable and appetizing,
each member of the family should do his or her share to
bring life and sunshine into the conversation.</p>

<p class='c009'>The directions which follow may, it is hoped, be helpful
in some degree to the young housekeeper, no matter what
her manner of living may be. It is easy to omit all but
one or two courses, thus making the table arrangement and
service simple; but the general principles may be observed
just the same.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>At the Breakfast Table.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Breakfast being the plainest meal of the day, the arrangement
of the table should always be simple. The cloth
should be spotless. At each person’s seat place a knife,
fork, teaspoon or dessert spoon, tumbler, and napkin, and
if fresh fruit is to be served, a finger bowl, if there be no
servant. If you have a waitress, she will place the finger
bowls on as you finish with the fruit. If fresh fruit be
served, there must also be placed at each seat a fruit knife
and plate. Have the dish of fruit in the centre of the
table. Have a tray cloth at each end of the table. Place
a little butter plate near the top of each plate. Put four
tablespoons on the table, either in two corners, or beside the
dishes where they will be used in serving. Put the carving
knife and fork at the head of the table, and the cups and
saucers, sugar and cream, coffee-pot, hot-water bowl, and
the mush dishes at the other end.</p>

<p class='c009'>The mistress of the house serves the mush, and when the
fruit and this course have been served, the dishes are removed
and the hot plates and other food brought in; the
head of the house serving the hot meats, etc., while the
mistress pours the coffee. It sometimes happens that a
man of business lacks time to serve breakfast, in which case
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>the mistress of the house attends to that duty. If there be
a waitress, she passes the plates when they are ready; also
the bread, butter, and coffee. The hostess usually puts the
sugar and cream in the coffee, first asking each one if he
will have these additions. After all have been served, it is
quite common to dismiss the waitress, ringing for her if her
services be again required. When there is but one servant,
the family help each other after the breakfast has been
placed upon the table. Fresh water is good for most people,
and each person should be served with a tumblerful on
taking a seat at the table. If there be hot cakes or waffles,
they should come after the meats, and there should be a
fresh set of warm plates, as well as of knives and forks.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>The Dinner Table.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The silver required depends upon the number of courses
to be served, but a few suggestions may help one to decide
what is proper for her own table. The silver for all the
courses except the dessert may be put on the table when
it is set, or it may be placed there by the waitress as needed
for each course. Dinner plates are placed on the table
or not, when it is set, as one pleases. The silver needed
for an ordinary course dinner would be a small fork for raw
oysters, tablespoon for soup, fork for fish, knife and fork for
meat, and fork for salad; carving knife and fork at the head
of the table, soup ladle at the head of the mistress’s plate,
and, if the dinner be served from the table, spoons for
serving.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the centre of the table set rather a low dish containing
flowers or ferns. On each side of it place some small
dishes of pretty design for olives, salted almonds, confectionery,
and such things; or these small dishes may be set
in the corners of the table. If the dinner is to be served
on the table, the small dishes should be put in the corners;
but if it is to be served from the sideboard, such dishes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>may be placed wherever they look best and are most convenient.
Lay the tablespoons in pairs; in the corners, of
course, if the dinner is to be served on the table. In the
fold of each napkin lay a small square of bread or a small
roll. The fruit and dishes for the dessert may be disposed
on the sideboard. All the dishes for a handsome dinner
service may be of one pattern, or for each course a different
kind of china may be used. For the olives, almonds, etc.,
it is desirable to have bits of cut glass, or pretty little china
dishes. Such wares are used much more than silver. The
dishes on which fish, meats, and entrées are served may be
round, oval, square, plain white, or richly colored Chinese or
Japanese ware. The plates for the several courses are, of
course, carefully to be kept hot or cold, as each course may
require, until serving time. After-dinner coffee cups, when
all are of different patterns, give a remarkably pretty effect.
Indeed, there is so much that is beautiful in table-ware
nowadays that one can have a handsome service with
means either large or limited.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Luncheon and Tea.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Family luncheons and teas are rarely served in courses.
Tea, cocoa, or chocolate is, as a rule, served at these meals,
so that the table is set in practically the same manner as
for breakfast; but the plates are placed for each person,
and unless there be meat to carve, the carving knife and
fork are not put on. The bread, butter, cake, preserves,
etc., are placed on the table when it is set. If hot meats,
vegetables, soup, or cakes be served, the cold plates must
be changed for hot ones. When meats, vegetables, or salads
have been served at these meals, the plates should be
changed before the cake and preserves are passed.</p>

<p class='c009'>For luncheon, such dishes as these are suitable: eggs in
any form, soups, salads, cold meats, with baked or warmed
up potatoes, any kind of broiled meat or fish, any simple
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>made dish, fresh fruit, stewed fruit, preserves, cake, gingerbread,
etc.</p>

<p class='c009'>Any dish (except soup and fresh fruit) that you serve for
luncheons will be suitable for tea.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Duties of the Waitress.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Although every housekeeper may have some methods
peculiarly her own in the matter of waiting upon the table,
still there are some customs that are almost universal in
refined households.</p>

<p class='c009'>If the water has not already been poured, the waitress
pours it as soon as the guests sit down at the table. If
there be raw oysters, they should be served first. Usually
they are arranged on the plates, and placed at each person’s
seat before the guests come in.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the oyster plates have been removed, the soup
tureen and hot soup plates are placed before the hostess.
The waitress lifts the cover off the tureen, inverting it at
once, that no drops of steam shall fall from it, and carries
it from the room. The hostess puts a ladleful of soup into
each plate and hands it to the waitress, who places it before
the guests, going in every case to the right hand side.
Some hostesses always serve the ladies first, while others
serve the guests in rotation.</p>

<p class='c009'>The meat is set before the host, the vegetables being
placed before the hostess or on the sideboard, as one
chooses. The waitress passes each plate as the host hands
it to her. She then passes vegetables, bread, sauce, etc.</p>

<p class='c009'>The salad is to be served by the hostess. After that the
table is brushed and the dessert is brought in and placed
before the hostess. The coffee follows. If fruit be served,
it is passed before the coffee.</p>

<p class='c009'>Finger bowls are brought in after the made dessert has
been served. A dainty doily is spread on a dessert plate
and the finger bowl placed on this. The bowl should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>about one quarter full of water. Each guest lifts the bowl
and doily from the plate and places them at the left hand
side. The doily is never to be used to wipe the fingers.</p>

<p class='c009'>A good waitress will not pile one dish upon another when
removing them from the table. She should be provided
with a tray for all the smaller dishes, and should remove the
plates one or two at a time.</p>

<p class='c009'>All dishes from which people help themselves, such as
vegetables, bread, butter, etc., should be passed at the left;
those that are set before people, such as soup plates, clean
plates, water glasses, finger bowls, etc., should be passed
at the right.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Serving Meals without a Servant.</h3>

<p class='c011'>A housekeeper who keeps no servant is often puzzled as
to how to serve dessert, how to serve the other dishes at
dinner, whether the plates should be distributed on the
table or placed beside the carver, and so forth.</p>

<p class='c009'>The conditions are so different in different families that
no arbitrary rules can be given for these things, but here
are a few suggestions which may be helpful. Have everything
ready in the kitchen to put on the table without
delay, and place the dishes where they will keep hot until
wanted. Eggs in any form must, of course, be served as
soon as cooked; therefore they must be timed very carefully.
The mush should be put on the table at the housekeeper’s
own place, and served in saucers or little dishes
that come for that purpose. Any one who does not eat
mush or fruit may decline it, and wait for the next course.
After the mush has been served, remove the dishes, and
place the rest of the breakfast on the table. The plates
should be hot, and be piled before or at one side of the
carver. While he is serving, pour the coffee. When there
is another member of the family who can put the second
course on the table, the housekeeper should be relieved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>of this part of the work. It is hard on a woman not
only to have to prepare the breakfast, but also to rise
from the table, bring in the second course and serve this,
as she often must, since, as a rule, men are in a hurry in
the morning and cannot assist their wives in serving the
breakfast.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c010'>Going to Market.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c011'>WHEN a housekeeper understands just what to do, and
can spend the time to go to the market herself, she
will find that she can have a better table, with greater variety
and at less expense, than when she orders from the provision
man who comes to the house each day. It is true that there
are a great many housekeepers who have neither time nor
strength for daily or even weekly visits to the markets, but
the average housekeeper has the time, and she will find that
in the end it will add to her mental and physical health, as
well as to the attractiveness of her table.</p>

<div  class='figleft id001'>
<img src='images/p061a.png' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>FIRST FIVE RIBS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>In ordering at the house it is a difficult matter to keep in
mind all the things that the provision man briskly calls off.
Even if he should not miss many little things that one might
choose for the sake of economy and variety, it would be
almost impossible to remember them all when giving him
the order. In the market, however, the articles are spread
out before you, and one thing suggests another. Here the
prices can be kept in mind when selecting the food; and
should the thing that you have decided upon be too expensive,
something else that you will find to be nearly or
equally good may be substituted. For example, you may
have planned to have halibut for dinner, and found that, instead
of being eighteen cents, it has gone up to twenty-five
or thirty cents. You will naturally hesitate before adding
fifty per cent to the expense of the dish. A cod, haddock,
whitefish, red-snapper, or something else of moderate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>price, will make a satisfactory substitute. Although the
prices of beef, mutton, pork, etc. are not subject to great
changes, the prices of fresh fish, vegetables, fruit, and game
fluctuate constantly.
Then again, many little
savory dishes are
suggested by the sight
of the various little
odds and ends found
in the stalls. The
sight and odor of a
piece of smoked bacon
may give you
visions of the many
savory dishes to which it will give relish,—liver and bacon,
chicken livers en brochette, and rashers of bacon with chops
or beefsteak.</p>

<div  class='figright id001'>
<img src='images/p061b.png' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>CHUCK RIBS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>In the market, too, perhaps you will see sheep’s hearts,
which when boiled make a cheap and savory breakfast, luncheon,
or supper dish. Calves and lambs’ tongues are both
cheap and good. They may be kept in brine for a week or
two and then boiled, the same as beef tongue; or they may
be boiled while fresh. They make an attractive dish when
served in jelly, or
they may be braised,
and served with vegetables
à la jardinière,
making an
elegant as well as
an economical dish.
Sheep and lambs’
kidneys are delicious
when broiled,
stewed, or sautéd.
They are always cheap. Perhaps you may see a piece
of honeycomb tripe which would make a pleasing dish
for breakfast. The liver of nearly all animals is used, but
beef, calves, and pigs’ livers are the most common. Sheep
and lambs’ livers are delicious.</p>

<p>SIRLOIN ROAST,—SECOND CUT.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Perhaps you want just about two pounds of the neck of
mutton for a broth. You see it cut off and are sure to get
nearly what you want.
It may be you want a
pound or two of the
round of beef chopped
for a Hamburg steak or
for beef tea. If you
see it cut, you will not
get three or four pounds
instead of two. This is
true of all the cuts of
meat and fish. It is a
rare thing that the provision man, who takes your order
at the house, does not bring you more than you want. In
the fish, vegetable, and fruit market there is constant
change, and we cannot be well supplied with the best and
cheapest except by a personal visit to the sales place.</p>

<p class='c009'>If one have a large and cold room to keep stores in, and
the family be large, it will pay to buy in quantity, provided
the housekeeper knows what to do with the supplies when
she gets them.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>In cold weather I often buy a hind quarter of mutton.
To give the housekeeper an idea of what can be done
with such a piece of meat, let me explain how I use it.
This is for a family of three, with an average of one
guest for one meal each day. It must be kept in mind
that the part of the hind quarter which will spoil first is the
flank; next come the ribs and loin; the leg will keep many
weeks if hung in a cold dry place. When the piece of
mutton is sent home, I cut off the flank and the thin end of
the ribs, leaving the rib and loin chops quite short. Should
I want to cook any of the chops that day or the next I cut
off the required number, but if I do not care to use them for
several days, they are not cut off until that time. The piece
of meat is now hung in my cold room, and cut from as
required. The flank and thin ribs are freed from every bit
of fat; the lean meat is cut into cubes and placed in a stewpan
with four tablespoonfuls of chopped onion, a generous
half-cupful of pearl barley, two level tablespoonfuls of salt,
one level teaspoonful of pepper, and three quarts of cold
water. These materials for a soup are placed on the fire
and skimmed carefully when they begin to boil; then the
stewpan is set back where the contents will just bubble for
three hours. The bones are placed in another stewpan
with one quart of cold water. They cook for two hours and
then the water is strained into the soup in the other stewpan.
When the soup has been cooking for three hours, two
tablespoonfuls of butter are put into a small frying-pan and
set on the fire. When this becomes hot, two tablespoonfuls
of flour are stirred into it, and when the mixture becomes
smooth and frothy it is added to the soup; after which a
tablespoonful of chopped parsley is added. The result is a
gallon of the most delicious Scotch broth. This soup is just
as good when warmed over as when first made, and it is so
substantial that it answers for luncheon, no meat, fish, or
vegetables being required. From the remainder of the
hind quarter I get fourteen chops, cutting the last four from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>the leg, and a good roast. All the fat is rendered for soap
grease; and as I make my own soap, this is quite an item.</p>

<p>SIRLOIN ROAST.<br /><br />A, Tenderloin. B, Back of Sirloin. C, Flank. D, Suet.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The weight of the hind quarter described is about twenty
pounds, and I save about one third what it would cost me
to buy the soup meat, chops, and roast separately. One
must have a good sharp knife, a meat-saw, and a cleaver to
cut up meats in this manner.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before going to market one should look through her
supplies, and then make a list of things for use with them.
A list of the meals that are to be arranged, and such purchases
as must be made for these meals, is next in order.
One may find it best to make radical changes in her plans
when she gets to the market; still, the list will be a great
aid as a guide. With it, one is not likely to buy too much
or too little.</p>

<p>RIB CHOP AFTER TRIMMING.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>In some places it is a great pleasure to go through the
markets, especially on the regular market days. This is
particularly true where there is a large German or French
population. The women of these nationalities have stalls
where they sell eggs, butter, cheese, poultry, fruit, vegetables,
and flowers,—the product of their own and neighbors’
farms. Nothing can be brighter or more picturesque than
are such markets in the spring, summer, and fall, when
flowers and vegetables are in abundance. Even the poor laborer’s
wife takes home her little growing plant, or a bunch
of fresh flowers. Going to market has not been all prose
to that poor woman, although she had to calculate very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>closely in her purchases for her table; for has she not had
the sight and odor of the plants and green vegetables, and
did not their beauty and freshness fill her mind with visions
of a beautiful and fragrant country? What a pity there are
not such markets in all our cities!</p>

<p class='c009'>If you have never made a practice of going to market,
try the plan now. It will pay you.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Buying Food for a Small Family.</h3>

<div  class='figleft id009'>
<img src='images/p070.png' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>LOIN.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>A woman who has to provide for a large family can plan
and buy with greater economy than if her family consisted of
only two or three. This
is especially the case
with meats and some
kinds of fish. In buying
meats, if the family be
small, it is wiser to get
only the parts actually
wanted than to buy
large pieces, simply because
they are cheaper
by the pound. When
planning to cook a large
piece of meat or fish, its adaptability to being made over
into various little dishes should be considered. Pork is
the least desirable of the fresh meats for such purposes.
For warming over in various ways the following-named
meats are the most valuable: poultry, veal, lamb, mutton,
and beef. The white meats are better than the red for
this purpose. This is also true of fish; the white, dry varieties
are much better for made-over dishes than the dark,
oily kinds.</p>

<p class='c009'>The smallest prime roast of beef is one of the short ribs,
weighing from three to four pounds. There are two of
these short ribs. In Boston they are called the tip of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>sirloin; outside New England, the short ribs or first cut of
the ribs. The two ribs are included in the cut, but it is
possible to get the cut divided.</p>

<p class='c009'>A small loin of lamb, mutton, or veal, weighing about three
or four pounds, makes a roast that will not last forever.
Great care must be
used in treating
these small roasts.
The heat must be
moderate after the
roast is browned and
there must be a
generous and frequent
basting, else
the meat will be
dry.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>RUMP.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>A turkey weighing between six and seven pounds is
about the smallest one can find in the market, but it can
be served in so many ways that one need not grow to hate
the sight of turkey before it is all gone.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the season of lamb it is possible to get a small leg from
which there can be cut one or two cutlets. The remainder
of the leg can be roasted the following day. If there be a
cold room where meats can be hung, a leg of mutton can
be used for several meals. Cut off about one third for a
roast. In about two or three days cut off a thick slice, to
be breaded and fried, and served with tomato sauce. In
four or five days the remainder of the leg can be roasted.
The leg of mutton that one can get small enough for this
purpose will probably be what butchers call yearling lamb.
It is not possible to get the best kind of beef or mutton in
so light a weight that it can be used to advantage in a
small family.</p>

<p class='c009'>One grouse or partridge, a chicken, duck, or rabbit, a
pair of pigeons or of quail, all can be used as a roast in a
family of two.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>Here are some of the things that can be bought in small
quantities: half a pound of sausages, a thin slice of ham
that will not weigh more than half a pound, a quarter of a
pound of dried beef, a quarter of a pound of smoked
bacon, a quarter of a pound of smoked salmon or halibut,
one pound of salt codfish, which will answer for three or
four dishes,—fish-balls, fish in cream, fish hash, etc.; one
thin slice of round steak, weighing about a pound, can be
used for beef olives or roll; a slice of veal from the leg
can be used in the same way; a piece of beef, cut from
the shoulder, and weighing about two or three pounds, can
be braised; about a pound and a quarter of fresh beef, cut
from any of the tough parts of the animal, can be prepared
in a stew; mutton and veal can be used in the same way.</p>

<p class='c009'>A short porter-house steak may be made to answer for
two meals. Cut out the tenderloin, broil it, and serve with
brown or mushroom sauce. The remainder of the steak
should be put in a cold place and used a day or two later.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>LEG OF MUTTON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>In summer vegetables should be bought from day to day,
as they are required. In the fall and winter tuberous
vegetables may be bought in larger quantities, if there be a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>cool place in which to store them. The common white
potatoes may be purchased by the barrel, but as the sweet
potato decays rapidly, it is best to buy it by the pound.
Carrots, turnips, beets, onions, squash, etc., are vegetables
that can be stored, and if one live in a country town it will
be well to store them; but for the housekeeper in the city
it will be economy to purchase these vegetables only as she
requires them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Squash spoils quickly after it has been cut. Since one
can purchase as small a quantity as two or three pounds, it
would, therefore, be unwise to buy a whole squash simply
because it costs a little less per pound than when bought
in a small quantity.</p>

<p class='c009'>If one have a cold cellar, it would be well to put in one
or two barrels of apples late in the fall; but as all fruits as
well as vegetables require a low, dry temperature, it would
be unwise to make large purchases unless one have a proper
place to keep them in.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Butter, Eggs, and Milk.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Butter is an expensive article, and should be selected
with care. If one have the proper place for storing it, and
can get it direct from some trustworthy dairy, it would be
economical to purchase the winter’s supply in October.
About fifty pounds will be enough for a family of two for
six months. This should be put up in two or three small
tubs. It must be kept in a cool, sweet place.</p>

<p class='c009'>Eggs, of course, are best fresh. It is wise economy for
the young housekeeper to pay the extra price, and always
be sure of the quality of her supply.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pure milk is a most important adjunct to the table. As
far as it is in her power to do so, the housekeeper should
see that the supply comes from a wholesome source, and
then do her part to keep the milk good by having the vessels
perfectly clean and the surroundings such that the milk
shall not be contaminated.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>About Groceries.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Flour, if stored in a cool, sweet, dry place, will be better
for bread-making if kept several months after being made.
All the meals are better when fresh, and only a small quantity
should be purchased at a time. Sugar is about the
same price, whether you buy it in small or large quantities.
It saves much bother to buy the granulated and cut sugar
in sufficient quantities to last a month or more. Powdered
sugar “cakes,” and only a small amount should be kept
in store. English breakfast tea improves with age, while
the lighter teas do not. The green coffee berry grows better
as it grows older; but after coffee is roasted it quickly
loses strength and flavor, so that only a small quantity of
the roasted berry should be bought at one time.</p>

<p class='c009'>Buy flavors, spices, etc. in small quantities, and get only
the purest. The store closet should always contain macaroni,
rice, fine breakfast hominy, tapioca, barley, corn-starch,
arrowroot, farina, chocolate, breakfast cocoa, tea, coffee,
some of the cereal preparations for mush, white and red
pepper, mustard, a small supply of whole spices, such as
cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, mace, allspice, and pepper; also
ground cinnamon, mace, and allspice. The less ground
clove one uses the better. It is well to have on hand a
bunch each of dried thyme, savory, and sage, and half an
ounce of bay leaves, which can be purchased at the grocer’s
or druggist’s, a few packages of gelatine, and a small package
of sea-moss farina, which insures a foundation for a
cold dessert at short notice.</p>

<p class='c009'>For emergencies, the store closet should always contain
some canned peas, tomatoes, corn, fruit, chicken, salmon, a
box of fancy crackers, some plain soda crackers, a bottle of
olives, and a can of condensed milk. One need never be
at a loss to prepare a good meal at short notice with this
supply in reserve.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>CARE OF FOOD.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>One may buy food with good judgment, and yet fail
to be an economical provider because she does not take
proper care of it. Perfect cleanliness is essential for the
best preservation of food. The cellar, pantries, storerooms,
refrigerators, and all the receptacles in which food is kept,
should be frequently inspected and thoroughly cleaned.
Heat and moisture tend to cause decay; therefore it is
important that all foods should be surrounded with pure,
cool, dry air. When it is possible, expose every closet and
food receptacle to the sun and air several times a week.</p>

<p class='c009'>All kinds of cooked food, particularly the animal foods,
spoil quickly when covered closely while still warm. All
soups, meat, fish, bread, etc., that are to be kept for many
days or hours, should be cooled thoroughly and quickly in a
current of cold air. In hot weather it is a good plan, when
cooling soups, milk, or any liquid mass, to place the vessel
containing the food in another of cold water,—with ice, if
convenient,—and set it in a cool draught.</p>

<p class='c009'>All meat, when not hung up, should be placed on a dish
and set in a cool place. If poultry be drawn, and a few
pieces of charcoal be placed in the body, it will keep longer
than if hung undrawn. It must not be washed until it is to
be cooked. The dryer the meat is kept the better.</p>

<p class='c009'>A dish of charcoal placed in the refrigerator or pantry
helps to keep the atmosphere dry and sweet.</p>

<p class='c009'>Milk and butter should be kept in a cool place, and away
from all strong odors.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bread and cake must be thoroughly cooled before being
put in boxes or jars; if not, the steam will cause them to
mould quickly. The bread box should be washed, scalded,
and thoroughly aired in the sun, twice a week. The crusts
and stale pieces of white raised bread, for which there is no
other use, should be put in a pan, be dried slowly in a warm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>oven, and then be pounded, sifted, and put in glass jars for
future use.</p>

<p class='c009'>All the trimmings of fat should be rendered while they
are sweet; then strained into jars or pails kept for that purpose.
Put beef, pork, and chicken fat together; this will
answer for deep frying. Ham, bacon, and sausage fat
answers for frying potatoes, hominy, mush, etc. All the
strong-flavored fats, such as mutton, duck, turkey, and the
skimmings from boiled ham, are to be kept by themselves
for making soap.</p>

<p class='c009'>It should be remembered that pure fat will keep sweet
many months, but if water or any foreign substance be left
in it, it will spoil quickly. When rendering or clarifying
fat, cook it slowly until there are no bubbles. As long as
bubbles form, you may be sure that there is water in the fat.
If put away in that condition it will become rancid.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Clarifying Fat.</h3>

<p class='c011'>To clarify fat that has been used for frying, put it into a
frying kettle, being careful not to let the sediment go in, and
place the kettle on the fire. When the fat becomes hot,
add three raw potatoes cut into slices, and stir well. The
impurities gather on the potatoes. Three potatoes will be
enough for four pounds of fat. Whenever there are any
trimmings of fat from any kind of meat cut them in bits and
place in a frying-pan on the back part of the stove, where
they will cook slowly until all the liquid fat has been
extracted. Strain this into a pot kept for this purpose.</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as the fat is skimmed from soups, gravies, and the
water in which meat has been boiled, it should be clarified,
as the water and other objectionable particles contained in it
will cause it to become rancid if it stands a long time. Put
it on the stove, in a frying-pan, and heat it slowly. When
it becomes melted, set it where it will simply bubble, and
keep it there (being careful not to let it burn) until there is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>no motion, and all the sediment has fallen to the bottom of
the pan. When this stage is reached the fat is clarified.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sometimes fat that has been used several times for frying,
and has not been strained, will become dark and unfit for
use. This may be put into a kettle with about six times as
much hot water, boiled for twenty minutes, turned into a
large pan, and set in a cold place. When the contents of
the pan become cold, the fat will be found in the form of a
solid cake on the surface of the water. It must be removed,
and clarified in the manner already described.</p>

<p class='c009'>To clarify butter, put it in a stewpan, and set it on the
back part of the range, where it will heat slowly. When a
clear, oily substance is found on top, and a cloudy sediment
at the bottom of the pan, lift the pan gently and pour off
the clear substance, which will be the clarified butter.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the fat is ready to strain, draw it back where it will
partially cool; then strain it through a piece of cheese-cloth.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tin or stoneware vessels are the best in which to keep
fat. The pails in which lard comes are very good for soap
grease, because, knowing their exact capacity, one knows
just how much grease there is on hand. Have the pails
covered, and keep them in a cool place.</p>

<p class='c009'>Save for stock all the bones and trimmings from fresh
meat, the bones from roasts or broils, and such pieces of
cooked meat as are too tough or hard to serve cold or in
made dishes. Put these in a stewpan, with water enough
to cover them, and simmer for five or six hours. Strain into
a bowl, and cool quickly. No matter how little bone or
meat there may be, cook it in this way while it is fresh and
sweet. A gill of stock has great value in warming over
meats, fish, and vegetables.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Odds and Ends.</h3>

<p class='c011'>It is true that the care of remnants and their preparation
for the table is not a slight matter; but in the household
where attention is given to this matter there is no waste,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>and a pleasant change of fare can be made daily. If a
housekeeper looks into her larder each morning, and avails
herself of the opportunities she finds to make little dishes
of the bits of food which she sees before her, the work of
caring for the odds and ends may become a pleasure rather
than a burden; the preparation of this food giving a bright
woman an opportunity to exercise much taste and skill in
producing dainty and healthful dishes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pieces of cold meat or fish may be divided into small
pieces, and warmed in a white or brown sauce; or the
sauce and meat or fish may be put in a small baking dish,
covered with grated bread crumbs, and then browned in
the oven. If there be not enough fish or meat to serve to
the entire family, use an extra quantity of sauce, and fill up
the dish with either well seasoned mashed potatoes, hominy,
rice, or macaroni. Cover lightly with grated bread crumbs,
and dot with butter. Bake this for half an hour in a moderately
hot oven.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cold meat or fish may be hashed fine and mixed with
potato, rice, or hominy, and a sauce, and made into
croquettes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bits of cooked ham or sausages may be minced fine and
mixed with hashed potatoes; the mixture being then well
seasoned and put into a frying-pan, with a little butter or
sweet drippings, and browned. If there be a little gravy of
any kind, it may be added to any of the above-mentioned
dishes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nearly all kinds of vegetables may be combined in a salad
or a hash.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tough pieces of meat and bones may be used in making
little stews or a little soup stock. All kinds of meats may
be combined in making a stew or soup.</p>

<p class='c009'>A few spoonfuls of almost any kind of meat, fish, or vegetable
may be heated in a sauce and spread over a plain
omelet, just before rolling it up, thus giving a change in
this dish of eggs.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>A soft-boiled egg left from a meal may be boiled until
hard, and then used in a salad or an egg sauce.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pieces of bread may be used for puddings and griddle-cakes,
and, in the form of dried crumbs, for breading.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pieces of cake and gingerbread may be used in puddings.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gravies, sauces, and soups, no matter how small the quantity,
should be saved to use in warming over meat, fish, or
vegetables.</p>

<p class='c009'>A few tablespoonfuls of cold rice or hominy are often
a pleasing addition to muffins or griddle-cakes. Indeed,
it is rarely necessary to waste a particle of food if the
proper attention be given to the little details of kitchen
management.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <br />SOUPS.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c010'>A Good Plain Stock.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>7 quarts of cold water.</div>
      <div class='line'>A shin of beef weighing ten pounds.</div>
      <div class='line'>4 tablespoonfuls of butter.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 generous tablespoonful of salt.</div>
      <div class='line'>A piece of cinnamon two inches long.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 teaspoonful of pepper-corns.</div>
      <div class='line'>A tiny bit of mace.</div>
      <div class='line'>6 whole cloves.</div>
      <div class='line'>1/2 pint of minced onion.</div>
      <div class='line'>4 tablespoonfuls of minced carrot.</div>
      <div class='line'>4 tablespoonfuls of minced celery.</div>
      <div class='line'>A bouquet of sweet herbs.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Have the butcher cut the shin of beef into several parts.
Wash it in cold water, and then cut off any particles that
do not seem perfectly sweet. The lower end of the leg,
near the hoofs, is apt to be a little tainted. Cut all the meat
from the bones, and then cut it into small pieces. Put one
tablespoonful of the butter in the soup pot, and place on
the hottest part of the fire. Put the meat in the pot, and
stir frequently until it is browned. It will take about half
an hour for this. At first the juices are drawn out of the
meat, making a great deal of liquid in the pot. The cooking
must be continued until all this juice has evaporated,
leaving a dry, brown substance on the bottom of the pan.
Now add one pint of the water, and stir the meat well,
scraping the brown substance from the bottom of the pot.
Add the remainder of the water and the salt and bones.
As soon as the soup comes to the boiling point, skim carefully
several times. Lay a piece of cheese-cloth in a strainer
and place in a bowl. Skim into this, and when the soup has
ceased to throw up any more scum, pour back into the soup
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>pot the clear liquid which will be found in the bowl. Draw
the soup pot back where the contents will bubble gently for
eight hours.</p>

<p class='c009'>Put the minced vegetables and three tablespoonfuls of
butter in a small frying-pan, and cook slowly for half an
hour. At the end of that time draw forward to a hotter
part of the range and stir until they begin to brown; then
draw them to one side of the pan and press out the butter.
Add them to the soup, and pour the butter into a cup, as
it will be useful in making sauces.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tie up the spice and the bouquet of sweet herbs in a
piece of cheese-cloth and put into the soup pot. Cook
the soup for an hour and a half longer; then strain through
a coarse napkin into two or three bowls, and cook rapidly.
Set away in a cold place and it will become a jelly. When
about to use it, remove all the fat and turn into a saucepan,
being careful to keep back any sediment there may
be at the bottom of the bowl. It will then be ready to
serve as a clear soup; or it can have any kind of a garnish
added to it, such as cooked rice, macaroni, vegetables, etc.
It may require a little more salt and pepper.</p>

<p class='c009'>This soup may be kept for months if sealed in jars.
Have the jars hot and the soup boiling hot. On filling
the jars, seal at once, and keep in a cool, dark place.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Second Stock.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Put away in a cold place the meat and bones which were
left from the strained stock. In the morning add six
quarts of water to it, and cook gently for six hours; then
strain and put away to cool. This stock lacks the fine
flavor of the first stock, but it is useful for thick soups,
sauces, and made-over dishes.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>Macaroni Soup.</h3>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1-1/2 pints of clear soup.</div>
      <div class='line'>4 sticks of macaroni.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 teaspoonful of salt.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Break the macaroni into small pieces and throw it into
one quart of boiling water containing the teaspoonful of salt.
Let it boil for twenty-five minutes with the cover off the
stewpan. Drain off the water and add the macaroni to the
hot stock. Cover, and cook for ten or fifteen minutes,
being careful to have the soup only bubble at one side. It
may require a little more salt and pepper.</p>

<p class='c009'>Vermicelli and any of the smaller forms of Italian paste
may be added to the clear stock and cooked gently for
about twenty minutes.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Rice Soup.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Wash two tablespoonfuls of rice and cook it the same as
the macaroni; then drain it, and add to the pint and a
half of hot stock. Cook the mixture gently for ten
minutes.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Beef Soup.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>2 pounds of beef from the round.</div>
      <div class='line'>2 quarts of water.</div>
      <div class='line'>2 tablespoonfuls of minced onion.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 tablespoonful of minced carrot.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 tablespoonful of minced celery.</div>
      <div class='line'>1/2 pint of potatoes, chopped fine.</div>
      <div class='line'>1/2 gill of barley.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 clove.</div>
      <div class='line'>2 tablespoonfuls of butter.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 tablespoonful of flour.</div>
      <div class='line'>1/6 teaspoonful of pepper.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 teaspoonful of salt.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Free the meat from fat and cut it into fine pieces. Put
it in the soup pot with the cold water and heat slowly to
the boiling point. Skim carefully, and set back where the
soup will just bubble at one side of the pot. Wash the
barley and put it on to cook in one pint of cold water.
At the end of half an hour pour off the water and add the
barley to the soup. When the soup has been cooking for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>three hours put the butter, minced onion, carrot, and celery
into a frying-pan and cook slowly for fifteen minutes.
Skim the vegetables from the butter and put them in the
soup. Stir the flour into the butter remaining in the pan.
Cook until brown, stirring all the while; then add to the
soup. Now add the potatoes and salt and pepper, and
cook for half an hour longer.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Oxtail Soup.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1 oxtail.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 quart of water.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 pint of stock.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 heaping tablespoonful of corn-starch.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 tablespoonful of minced celery.</div>
      <div class='line'>2 tablespoonfuls of minced onion.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 tablespoonful of minced carrot.</div>
      <div class='line'>20 pepper-corns.</div>
      <div class='line'>2 whole cloves.</div>
      <div class='line'>A tiny bit of mace.</div>
      <div class='line'>A small piece of cinnamon.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 bay leaf.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 small leaf of sage.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 small sprig of parsley.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 small sprig of thyme.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Free the oxtail from fat and cut into small joints. Wash
these in several waters and then put them in a stewpan with
the cold water. Place on the range and heat slowly to the
boiling point; then skim, and move the stewpan back
where the water will just bubble at one side of the stewpan.
Cook for one hour. Tie the vegetables, herbs, and
spice in a piece of netting, and put them in the stewpan.
Add the salt, and cook for one hour longer. Strain the
broth into a bowl and set away in a cold place. Rinse the
oxtail in cold water and put in a cold place.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the broth is cold, skim off all the fat. Put the
soup stock and skimmed broth in a stewpan, and set on
the fire. When this boils, add the corn-starch, mixed
smoothly with a gill of cold water. Cook for fifteen minutes;
then add the oxtail and cook for ten minutes longer.
Taste, to see if seasoned enough, and serve very hot.</p>

<p class='c009'>A few tablespoonfuls of sherry will improve this soup for
many tastes. It should be added just before the soup is
poured into the tureen.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>Veal Broth.</h3>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>2 pounds of the poorer parts of veal.</div>
      <div class='line'>2 quarts of water.</div>
      <div class='line'>3 tablespoonfuls of minced onion.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 tablespoonful of minced carrot.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 whole clove.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 inch piece of cinnamon.</div>

      <div class='line'>2 tablespoonfuls of flour.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 pint of raw potato cubes.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Cut the veal into cubes and put the bones and meat into
a stewpan with the water, seasoning, and vegetables. Place
on the fire, and when the soup comes to the boiling point,
skim carefully, and then set back where it will just bubble.
Heat the butter in a small saucepan, and add the flour to
it. Stir until the mixture is smooth and frothy; then stir
it into the broth. Simmer the broth for two hours and a
half, and, after adding the pint of potato cubes, cook for
half an hour longer.</p>

<p class='c009'>The potatoes may be omitted and a quarter of a cupful
of rice be added when the broth has been cooking for an
hour and a half.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Scotch Broth.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1-1/2 pounds of neck or shoulder of mutton.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 tablespoonful of pearl barley.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 tablespoonful of minced onion.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 tablespoonful of minced carrot.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 tablespoonful of minced turnip.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 tablespoonful of minced celery.</div>

      <div class='line'>1 teaspoonful of chopped parsley.</div>
      <div class='line'>3 pints of water.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Remove all the fat from the mutton and cut the lean
meat into cubes, which should be put in a stewpan with
the chopped vegetables, salt, pepper, and the barley, well
washed. Tie the bones in a piece of coarse white netting
and put them in the stewpan with the other ingredients.
Add the three pints of cold water and cover the stewpan.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>Place the soup on the stove where it will heat slowly to the
boiling point. When it reaches that temperature, skim it
and set back where it will only bubble slightly at one side of
the pan. Cook in this manner for three hours, being careful
not to let it more than bubble gently in all that time.
At the end of the three hours take out the bones. Now
put the butter in a little saucepan and set on the fire to
heat. When hot, stir in the flour, and cook—stirring all
the time—until the mixture is smooth and frothy. Stir
this into the broth; then add the chopped parsley, and cook
ten minutes longer.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Vegetable Soup.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1 pound of beef.</div>
      <div class='line'>2 quarts of water.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 gill of minced carrot.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 gill of minced turnip.</div>
      <div class='line'>1/2 gill of minced onion.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 tablespoonful of minced celery.</div>
      <div class='line'>1/4 pint of potato cubes.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 tablespoonful of rice.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 tablespoonful of flour.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 generous teaspoonful of salt.</div>
      <div class='line'>1/8 teaspoonful of pepper.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Cut the meat into cubes; then put it in a stewpan and
set on the fire with the cold water. When this boils, skim
carefully. Mix the flour to a smooth paste with one gill of
cold water, and stir into the boiling ingredients. Next
add the rice. Move the stewpan back where the contents
will bubble at one side for one hour; then add the onion
and carrot. Cook for one hour longer, and then put in the
turnips, potatoes, salt, and pepper, and simmer for half an
hour longer. Serve hot.</p>

<p class='c009'>Two quarts of the water in which the bones and hard
pieces of meat have been cooked may be substituted for
the beef and water. If one choose, half a pint of finely
shred cabbage may be added at the same time the onions
and carrots are put in the soup.</p>

<div>

  <h3 class='c010'>Chicken Soup.</h3>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>3 pints of the water in which a fowl was boiled.</div>

      <div class='line'>1/2 teaspoonful of parsley.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Wash the rice and put it in a stewpan with the chicken
stock. Place on the fire and cook for two hours. The soup
must not boil in that time; keep it where it will be at the
point of boiling, but do not let it bubble. At the end of
two hours put the butter and vegetables in a small frying-pan
and set on the fire, to cook slowly for twenty minutes.
Now draw the pan to a hotter part of the range, and stir for
one minute. After pressing the butter from the vegetables,
put them with the soup. Put the flour with the butter remaining
in the pan, and stir until smooth and frothy; then
stir the mixture into the soup. Add the salt, pepper, and
chopped parsley, and cook the soup for thirty minutes
longer, allowing it to bubble at one side of the saucepan.</p>

<p class='c009'>If you have a little cold chicken, cut it into small cubes
and add it to the soup at the same time the vegetables are
put in. If you cannot get celery, take half a teaspoonful
of celery salt, and in that case use only half a teaspoonful
of the common salt.</p>

<p class='c009'>This soup can be made with the stock from boiled fowl, or
that obtained by boiling the bones of roast chicken.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Cream of Rice Soup.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Make this in the same way as chicken soup, with the
addition of one tablespoonful of rice, a slight grating of nutmeg,
a tiny bit of mace, and a piece of stick cinnamon
about an inch long, and the omission of the parsley.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the time required for the cooking has expired, take
out the spice and pour the soup into a fine sieve. Rub all

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <br />FISH.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c005'>FRESH fish should frequently be substituted for meat.
For those who live in seaboard towns there is no
trouble in obtaining a variety. Every inland place has its
own peculiar species, which should have precedence over
other kinds; for the first thing to be taken into account is
freshness. Fish brought from a distance deteriorates with
the handling it receives and the time it is out of the water.</p>

<p class='c009'>The lighter the fish, the greater the variety of modes by
which it may be cooked. It also may be served more frequently
without one’s becoming tired of it. For example,
at the Isles of Shoals visitors are offered broiled scrod every
day in the week, yet they do not weary of the dish in a
stay of months. At Nantucket broiled bluefish is served
daily, and it is so delicious that its appearance three times
a day would at first be hailed with pleasure; but after a short
time the appetite would become palled, because the fish is
rich. It would be the same with the freshest and most
toothsome salmon and mackerel. A rich fish satiates much
sooner than a lighter and poorer kind, and for this reason
it is advisable to avoid having the richer varieties frequently.
Of course, the poorer kinds require more and richer sauces
than salmon, mackerel, or bluefish. Whitefish, like cod,
haddock, cusk, halibut, and flounders, is improved by the
addition of sauces made of milk, cream, or white stock.</p>

<p class='c009'>Boiling is the least desirable mode of preparing fish, because
it causes the greatest loss of flavor and nutriment.
A fine sauce is needed to make the dish satisfactory. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>boiling has one merit: the remains of the fish after the
first meal are in better form for use in little dishes of many
kinds than they are if any other way of cooking be employed.
Small fish, like brook trout, smelts, etc., are best
when fried.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>How to Boil Fish.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Fresh fish should always be put on to cook in salted
boiling water. A little lemon juice or vinegar in the water
makes the flesh of the fish firmer and improves the flavor.
For some tastes the flavor is improved still more by putting
in the water, tied in a piece of cheese-cloth, a few spoonfuls
of minced onion, carrot, and celery, two bay leaves,
a sprig each of thyme, parsley, and summer savory, a small
bit of cinnamon, and two whole cloves. There should be
only water enough to cover the fish. If there be a fish-kettle
with a tray, lay the fish in the tray and do not wrap
it in a cloth. If, however, there be no regular fish-kettle,
pin the fish in a piece of cloth, put a large plate in the
bottom of a large flat saucepan, and lay the fish on this.
A thick square of fish will take longer to cook than the
same number of pounds cut from a long, slender fish. A
small cod, haddock, bluefish, lake trout, salmon trout, whitefish,
etc., weighing from three to five pounds, will require
thirty minutes’ cooking. The water should bubble only at
the side of the saucepan. A large fish of the same kind,
weighing six or eight pounds, would require only ten minutes’
more time. A thick square or cube of halibut or salmon,
weighing from three to five pounds, would require forty
minutes’ cooking; and if it weighed six or eight pounds, it
would require an hour. If the fish be put into cold water
the juices will be drawn out. The fish will be broken if
the water be allowed to boil hard during the cooking. A
good sauce should always be served with boiled fish.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>

      <div class='line'>1 teaspoonful of salt.</div>
      <div class='line'>1/4 teaspoonful of pepper.</div>
      <div class='line'>2 tablespoonfuls of butter.</div>
      <div class='line'>1/2 teaspoonful of summer savory.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 teaspoonful of minced parsley.</div>
      <div class='line'>1/2 teaspoonful of onion juice.</div>
      <div class='line'>3 ounces of fat salt pork.</div>
      <div class='line'>A fish weighing about four or five pounds.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>For the dressing, mix the cracker crumbs, herbs, salt,
pepper, and butter together; then moisten with water, and
add the onion juice. Have the fish split and drawn, but
leave on the head and tail. Gut off the fins and scrape off
any scales that may still cling to it. Wash and wipe dry;
then rub one tablespoonful of salt into it, put the dressing
in the opening, and pin together with a skewer. Cut slits
on the top of the fish, about two inches long and half an
inch deep. Cut the salt pork in strips and fit them into
these slits.</p>

<p class='c009'>Butter a flat tin sheet and place in the dripping-pan.
Lay the fish in the pan, having uppermost the side containing
the pork. Dredge with pepper, salt, and flour. Put
enough hot water in the pan to cover the bottom, and place
in the oven. Bake for forty-five minutes, basting every
fifteen generously with the gravy in the pan and lightly with
salt, pepper, and flour. When done, lift the tin from the
dripping-pan and slide the fish upon a warm dish. Serve
with brown, tomato, or Hollandaise sauce.</p>

<p class='c009'>Fish that cannot be stuffed, such as halibut, may be
cooked in the same way. Three pounds of halibut would
be equivalent to a five-pound cod or haddock.</p>

<p class='c009'>In giving the rule for so large a fish, allowance was made
for the leaving of enough cold fish to make a dish of escaloped
fish the next day.</p>

  <h3 class='c010'>Baked Salt Mackerel.</h3>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1 salt mackerel of medium size.</div>
      <div class='line'>3 gills of milk.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 tablespoonful of butter.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 level tablespoonful of flour.</div>
      <div class='line'>1/8 teaspoonful of pepper.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Wash the mackerel and soak it in a pan of cold water,
having the split side down. In the morning put the fish,
split side up, in a shallow baking pan. Pour the milk over
it, and place in a moderate oven. When the mackerel has
been cooking for twenty minutes, mix the butter, flour, and
pepper, and stir the mixture into the milk in the pan. Cook
ten minutes longer; then slide the fish out on a hot dish
and pour the sauce over it. Serve hot.</p>

<p class='c009'>This dish is suitable for breakfast, luncheon, dinner, or
supper. Serve with it potatoes in some form.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>How Fish should be Broiled.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Simple as is the work of broiling a piece of fish, it is more
often done badly than well. If not cooked enough the fish
is extremely disagreeable to the taste, and if cooked too
much it is hard and dry. It is always best to have an exact
rule as to the time it shall be cooked; when the fish is put
on the fire, look at the clock, and take it off as soon as it is
done.</p>

<p class='c009'>A split fish, such as shad, whitefish, mackerel, scrod,
bluefish, etc., should be timed according to the thickness.
If the fire be bright and hot, a fish an inch thick
can be cooked twelve minutes. If two inches thick, it will
take twenty minutes. Of course, when the fire is dull it
will take longer.</p>

<p class='c009'>Always season fish with salt and pepper before cooking.
A fish with the skin on should be broiled with the skin side
from the fire until the last five minutes of cooking, when
that side can be turned to the fire; but it must be watched
closely, that it shall not burn.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>It is only dry halibut that requires the butter and flour
before broiling. Many people prefer to dip the slice of fish
in olive oil rather than butter. If the oil be used it must
not be heated, and it is well to apply it to the fish an hour
or more before the cooking.</p>

<p class='c009'>Various sauces are often served with broiled fish, but
there is nothing better than sweet butter, salt, pepper, a
little lemon juice, and perhaps a little chopped parsley; or,
the lemon juice may be omitted and a fresh lemon be cut
into six parts as a garnish for the dish. Each person can
then use as much of the acid as pleases him.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Broiled Halibut.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1-1/2 pounds of halibut.</div>
      <div class='line'>2 tablespoonfuls of butter.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 teaspoonful of lemon juice.</div>
      <div class='line'>1-1/2 teaspoonfuls of salt.</div>
      <div class='line'>1/4 teaspoonful of pepper.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Have the halibut cut in a slice about an inch thick. Put
half the butter, salt, and pepper in a hot soup plate, and
stir until the butter is melted. Wash and wipe the fish,
then lay it in the plate of seasoned butter. When one side
is coated with the butter, turn it down and season the other.
Dredge lightly with flour, place in the double-broiler, and
cook over a hot, bright fire for fourteen minutes. Put on a
hot dish and season with the remaining salt, pepper, butter,
and the lemon juice, all mixed. Serve very hot.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Fried Fish.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>2 pounds of fish.</div>
      <div class='line'>3 ounces of fat salt pork.</div>
      <div class='line'>1/4 teaspoonful of pepper.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 teaspoonful of salt.</div>
      <div class='line'>Flour.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Have the fish cut in slices about an inch thick. Season
these with the salt and pepper, and roll in flour. Cut the
pork in thin slices and fry until crisp and brown. Take
the pork from the pan, and put the fish in the hot fat.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>When it has become browned on one side, turn it and
brown the other side. It will take about twelve minutes to
fry the fish. Arrange on a hot dish and lay the slices of
pork on top. Serve hot.</p>

<p class='c009'>All small fish, such as trout, perch, and smelts, may be
cooked in this manner. Draw and wash them, but leave on
the heads and tails of the smelts and trout. Some kinds
of small fish need to be skinned, but this is done at the
market.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Breaded Fish.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1/2 pint of dried bread crumbs.</div>

      <div class='line'>1 egg.</div>
      <div class='line'>2 pounds of any kind of fish.</div>
      <div class='line'>Fat for frying.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Have the fish free from skin and bones, and cut it into
handsome pieces. Season it with the salt and pepper.
Beat the egg in a soup plate and dip the fish in it, one piece
at a time, getting every part covered with the egg; then
roll in the crumbs and lay on a plate. Have enough fat in
the frying kettle to float the fish. When it becomes so hot
that blue smoke rises from the centre, put in the fish and
cook for five minutes. Drain on brown paper and serve
very hot.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tartar sauce is particularly good to serve with breaded
fish. Smelts are especially palatable when cooked in this
manner.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Use any kind of cold cooked fish; but the white kinds,
such as halibut, cod, haddock, etc., are the best. Have it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>broken into flakes and freed of bones and skin. Season it
with half the salt and pepper. Put a generous half of the
butter in a small pan and set on the fire. When it is hot
add the flour, and stir until the mixture is smooth and
frothy; then gradually add the milk. Boil up once, and
stir in the remainder of the salt and pepper. Put a layer of
this sauce in a small baking dish, then a layer of the fish,
and follow with a second layer of sauce. Now put in the
rest of the fish and cover with the remainder of the sauce.
Sprinkle with the bread crumbs and dot with the other half
tablespoonful of butter. Bake in a moderately hot oven for
twenty minutes, and serve at once.</p>

<p class='c009'>The baking dish should hold nearly a pint.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Salt Codfish in Cream.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>

<p class='c009'>Cut the salt fish into pieces about an inch and a half
long, and tear these pieces into thin strips. Wash them
and, putting them in a bowl with one pint of cold water, let
them soak over night, or at least four or five hours. In the
morning put the fish and water in a saucepan and set on
the fire. Heat to the boiling point, but do not let boil.
Drain off the water, and, after adding the milk, heat again
to the boiling point.</p>

<p class='c009'>Beat the butter and flour together until light and smooth.
Stir this mixture in with the fish, and boil up once. Add
the pepper, and also some salt if any be required. Set
back where the fish will continue to cook, but not boil, for
twenty minutes.</p>

<p class='c009'>If cream be plentiful use half cream and half milk.
Serve baked or mashed potatoes with this dish.</p>

  <h3 class='c010'>Fish Balls.</h3>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1 cupful of raw salt codfish.</div>
      <div class='line'>6 potatoes of medium size.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 egg.</div>
      <div class='line'>1/2 teaspoonful of salt.</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Tear the raw fish into fine shreds, and measure out a
cupful. Pare the potatoes, and put them in a large stewpan.
Sprinkle the fish on top and cover with boiling water.
Cover, and cook for just thirty minutes. Pour off every
drop of the water, and mash the fish and potato together
until light and fine; then beat into the mixture the salt,
pepper, butter, and the egg, which should first be well
beaten. Shape into small balls, and, putting them in the
frying-basket, cook in deep fat until brown,—say for about
four or five minutes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Great care must be taken to follow the directions exactly,
and to have the fat so hot when the fish balls are put in
that blue smoke rises from the centre. If the fat be not
hot enough, or the water be not all drained off, or if too
much butter be used, the fish balls will absorb fat and be
spoiled. If all the work be done carefully, the dish will be
perfect.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Fish Cakes.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>1/4 teaspoonful of pepper.</div>
      <div class='line'>1/2 teaspoonful of salt.</div>
      <div class='line'>2 ounces of fat salt pork.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Wash the fish and soak it over night, in one piece. In
the morning put it in a saucepan and on the fire, with
enough cold water to cover it. When the water is heated
to the boiling point set the saucepan back where the water
will keep hot, but not boil. Cook the fish in this manner
for one hour; then take from the water and cool. When
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>cold, remove the skin and bones and chop the fish fine.
Pare the potatoes, and put them in a stewpan with boiling
water enough to cover them. Cook for just thirty minutes;
then drain off the water, and mash and beat the potatoes
with a fork. Beat the fish, butter, salt, pepper, and milk
into the potato. Shape the mixture into round, flat cakes,
and fry brown on both sides in pork fat.</p>

<p class='c009'>The pork is cut into slices and fried rather slowly until
crisp and brown. The pan is then placed on a hotter part
of the fire, and the pork removed; and as soon as the fat
is smoking hot, the cakes should be put in to brown.
Serve the cakes on a hot dish, garnishing them with the
slices of crisp pork.</p>

<p class='c009'>This is a generous amount for three people, and in some
families it may be found that half the amount will be
enough.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the fish cakes are for breakfast, cook, cool, and
mince the fish the day before. Pare the potatoes, and let
them stand in cold water over night. These preparations
will insure having the fish cakes on time and in perfection
for an early breakfast.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lobster should be perfectly fresh. If it be cooked, the
odor should be fresh and the shells look bright, and when

boil it, plunge it into boiling water and cook gently from
ten to twenty minutes. A very small lobster will cook in
ten minutes and a large one in twenty. Cooking a lobster
too long or at too high a temperature makes it tough, dry,
and stringy. When it is impossible to get the fresh lobster,
the canned article may be used instead, though it is of the

      <div class='line'>1 generous tablespoonful of flour.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 teaspoonful of salt.</div>
      <div class='line'>1/6 teaspoonful of Cayenne.</div>
      <div class='line'>1/6 teaspoonful of white pepper.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 teaspoonful of curry powder.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 tablespoonful of minced onion.</div>
      <div class='line'>3 slices of toast.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Cut the lobster into small pieces and season with half the
salt and pepper. Put the butter and onion on the fire, in a
frying-pan, and cook until the onion turns a straw color;
then add the flour and curry-powder and stir until brown.
Gradually add the stock to this, stirring all the while.
Season with the remainder of the salt and pepper, and
cook for three minutes. Strain this into a saucepan, and
add the lobster. Cook for five minutes. Cut the slices of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>toast in strips and lay in a warm dish. Pour the lobster
over these and serve at once.</p>

<p class='c009'>The toast may be omitted, and a dish of boiled rice be
served with the curry.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Fricassee of Lobster.</h3>

<p class='c011'>A fricassee of lobster is prepared the same as a curry;
omitting, however, the curry-powder and onion. Milk may
be substituted for the meat stock.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Breaded Lobster.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1 large lobster.</div>

      <div class='line'>Fat for frying.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Split the claws and tail and set aside. Take the meat
from the large joints and the body, and chop fine. Mix
with this one fourth of the teaspoonful of salt and two tablespoonfuls
of the “tom-alley.” Shape this into three small
flat cakes. Season the pieces of lobster with the salt and
pepper. Beat the egg in a soup plate. Dip the pieces of
lobster and the little cakes, one at a time, into the egg;
then roll in the bread crumbs, and, after arranging on a plate,
put in a cool place until the hour to cook them. When
that time comes, put the breaded lobster in the frying
basket and cook in fat until crisp and brown (about two
minutes). Serve with Tartar sauce.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Escaloped Lobster.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>3 gills of lobster.</div>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>gradually on the butter and the flour, stirring all the time.
Add half the salt and pepper, and cook for one minute.
Have the lobster cut fine, and seasoned with the other half
of the salt and pepper. When the sauce has cooked for
one minute, add the lobster. Now pour the mixture into a
shallow escalop dish. Sprinkle the grated bread crumbs
on this, and then dot with the half tablespoonful of butter.
Bake in a hot oven for fifteen minutes.</p>

<p class='c009'>If cream be used, measure the flour lightly; but if stock
be taken, allow a generous tablespoonful.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Escaloped Crabs.</h3>

<h3 class='c010'>Stewed Clams.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>

<p class='c009'>Put the milk on the fire in the double-boiler. Put the
clams in a strainer and pour a quart of cold water over
them. Let them drain for about one minute, and then,
turning them into a stewpan, place them on the stove.
Beat the butter and flour to a cream, and stir this mixture
into the pan containing the hot clams. Add the hot milk,
salt, and pepper, and cook for two minutes longer. Have
the crackers soaked for two minutes in cold water, and
then toasted. Lay them in the bottom of a deep dish, and
when the clams are stewed pour them over the toast.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>Roast Clams.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Wash the clam shells thoroughly and drain them in the
colander for a few minutes. Spread them in an old dripping-pan
and put them into a hot oven. The shells will
begin to open in five or eight minutes. Take them from
the oven, and, holding the shell over a warm dish, let the
clam and juice drop out. Season with butter, salt, and
pepper, and serve very hot, with thin slices of buttered
brown bread.</p>

<p class='c009'>When possible, get the clams twenty-four hours before
they are to be used, and after washing them thoroughly
put them in a pan with just enough cold water to cover
them; then, for a peck of clams, sprinkle in half a pint of
corn meal. This will make the clams plump and tender.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Steamed Clams.</h3>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER X.<br /> <br />HOW TO COOK MEAT.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c012'>BOILING.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c011'>IN boiling meats the temperature of the liquid should be
kept at about the boiling point or a few degrees lower;
that is, the water should bubble gently at one side of the
pot or stewpan. Great care must be taken that the water
shall never boil rapidly, and that the temperature shall not
be much lower than that indicated by a slight bubbling at
the side of the stewpan. The meat and liquid will both be
spoiled if kept for any length of time in a closed vessel with
the temperature too low. A piece of meat cooked in water
that boils rapidly all the time will be hard, dry, and stringy,
no matter how long it is cooked or how tender and good it
was originally; but even a tough, dry piece will be tender
and juicy if cooked at the temperature indicated by the
water’s bubbling at one side of the pot. All meats will be
juicier if they be allowed to cool, or even partially to cool,
in the liquid in which they were boiled. The dish in which
a food material is cooling must always be <i>uncovered</i> until
the substance is perfectly cold.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Boiled Leg of Mutton.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Wipe carefully with a damp cloth a leg of mutton weighing
between eight and ten pounds, and put it in a deep
kettle with enough boiling water to cover it. Set the kettle
where the water will boil rapidly for a quarter of an hour.
Skim the water when it begins to boil. At the end of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>fifteen minutes draw the kettle back where the water will
only bubble. If the meat be desired very rare, cook it for
an hour and a half; but if you want it rather well done,
cook it for two hours, being careful that the water only
bubbles except during the first fifteen minutes.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the mutton is done place it on a warm dish. Pour
a few tablespoonfuls of butter sauce over it, and, if convenient,
garnish with parsley. Send to the table at once with
the caper sauce and vegetables.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course, this is more meat than three persons would
want, but if only half a leg be boiled the result will not be
very satisfactory; therefore it would be better to roast or
steam a part of the leg, unless the family be large.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Steamed Mutton.</h3>

<p class='c011'>When the family is so small that it is necessary to cut a
leg of mutton, it is better to steam than to boil it. Place the
piece of mutton on a kitchen plate, the cut side down. Set
the plate in the steamer and over a kettle of boiling water.
Cover closely, and keep the water boiling until the meat is
done. A piece weighing about four or five pounds will be
cooked rather rare in one hour. If liked well done, cook
it longer. Serve the same as boiled leg of mutton.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Boiled Corned Beef.</h3>

<p class='c011'>A piece of corned beef will take about the same time to
cook, whether it weigh four pounds or ten. Wash the meat
and put it into a stewpan with enough boiling water to
cover it generously. When the water begins to boil, skim
thoroughly; then draw the stewpan back to a place where
the water will just bubble for five hours. Never let the
water boil hard, but it must not get much below the boiling
point at any time. If the meat is to be pressed, take it
from the boiling water and place it on a flat dish. Put a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>tin pan or sheet on top of the hot meat, and on this place
two bricks or some other weight. Set away in a cool place.
When the meat is cold, trim the edges, using a sharp knife.
The trimmings may be used for a corned beef hash.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Spiced Corned Beef.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>6 pounds of the plate piece of beef.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 pint of coarse salt.</div>
      <div class='line'>3 pints of water.</div>
      <div class='line'>3 dozen whole allspice.</div>
      <div class='line'>2 dozen whole cloves.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>This is a cheap and savory dish for luncheon and tea.
Put the water and salt in a stewpan and set on the fire.
Stir frequently until the water boils, and then skim carefully.
Take from the fire and set away to cool. Remove
the bones from the meat by slipping a sharp knife between
the flesh and bone and cutting the meat from the bone.
Place the beef in a stone jar or earthen bowl, and when the
brine is cold pour it over the meat. Cover the dish and set
it away in a cool place for six or eight days. At the end of
that time remove the meat and wipe it. Spread it on a
board and sprinkle the spice over it. Roll up and tie firmly.
Place this roll in a kettle and cover it with boiling water.
When the water begins to boil, (it will at first be somewhat
cooled by the meat,) skim it carefully; then set the kettle
back where the water will just bubble for six hours. At the
end of that time take the beef from the kettle and place it
on a large dish. Put upon it a tin pan and weights, (two
bricks will be sufficient,) and set away in a cool place. The
meat should be cut in thin slices when served.</p>

<p class='c009'>In New York many of the marketmen salt and spice beef
for their customers. If one can get a plate piece of corned
beef that has not been too long in brine, it will answer just
as well as a fresh piece, and save the housekeeper the
trouble of corning it. Almost any marketman will willingly
remove the bones for a customer.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>Boiled Ham.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Wash the ham and then soak it in cold water for ten or
twelve hours. Put it on to cook in cold water. When the
water begins to boil, skim it, and draw the kettle back to a
part of the range where the water will only bubble gently.
Cook the ham for five hours; then take it up and draw off
the skin. Place the skinned ham in a dripping-pan and
sprinkle over it one cupful of fine dried crumbs mixed with
two tablespoonfuls of sugar. Cook it slowly in the oven
for one hour.</p>

<p class='c009'>If only a part of a ham is to be boiled, it would be better
to steam it than to put it in the water. Wash and soak it;
then steam it the same as mutton, cooking it for six hours.
Brown it in the oven if you like.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Fresh Tongue.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Wash the tongue and put it in a stewpan with boiling
water enough to cover it generously. Add four tablespoonfuls
of salt. When the water begins to boil, skim carefully
and draw the stewpan back to a place where the water will
bubble gently for five hours. Take the tongue from the
boiling water and plunge it into cold water. Draw off the
rough skin, beginning at the roots of the tongue. Place the
tongue on a dish, cover it lightly with a coarse towel, and
put it in a cold place.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Smoked Tongues.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Cook a smoked tongue exactly the same as a ham, except
that it is not to be browned in the oven. It will require five
hours’ time to boil it.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Pickled Tongue.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Treat a pickled tongue the same as a piece of corned
beef. It will require five hours’ cooking.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>SCIENCE IN ROASTING MEAT.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>A roast of meat, be it rare or well done, should be juicy
and tender. One should not roast a tough piece of meat;
stewing, braising, or boiling is better, because the cooking
can be continued for a long time at a low temperature, and
this method will make the toughest piece of meat tender.
The meat always should be exposed to a high temperature at
first, that the surface may become hardened and the juices
protected. If the high temperature be continued all the
time of cooking, the meat will become hard, dry, and
stringy, as far as the heat has penetrated. It will be seen,
therefore, that the high temperature should be kept up only
long enough to form a thin, hard crust on the meat. From
twenty to thirty minutes will suffice for this. The temperature
should then be lowered by closing the draughts of the
range.</p>

<p class='c009'>Basting is another important item in roasting. If one
use no water in the dripping-pan, and baste only with the
fat that drops from the meat into the bottom of the pan, the
roast will have a beautiful glossy brown surface when it is
done; but it must be remembered that fat can be heated
to a much higher point than water, and that basting with
this boiling hot fat will help to harden the piece of meat.</p>

<p class='c009'>If a small quantity of water be kept in the bottom of the
dripping-pan, the drippings from the meat, mingling with
it, will be kept at a low temperature, so that, if the meat be
freely basted with this mixture every fifteen minutes, the
surface of the piece of meat will be kept moist, and at a
lower temperature than when basted with the hot fat, or
not basted at all. By basting with this mixture of drippings
and water, the heat is driven from the surface to the centre
of the piece of meat, insuring a roast that will be rare from
a point about half an inch from the surface to the centre.
Bear these facts in mind when roasting meats.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>How to Roast Meat in the Oven.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Have a dripping-pan of Russian iron and a meat-rack
three or four inches shorter than the pan.</p>

<div  class='figleft id012'>
<img src='images/p117a.png' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>DRIPPING-PAN.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div  class='figright id013'>
<img src='images/p117b.png' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>MEAT-RACK.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Examine the piece of meat, and if there be any places
that have become tainted trim them off with a sharp knife.
Wipe the meat with a wet towel. Now season with salt and
pepper, and dredge lightly with flour.</p>

<p class='c009'>All the seasoning must be done with the meat resting on
the rack, that the stray particles may fall to the bottom of
the pan. Dredge flour over the bottom of the pan until the
surface is white.</p>

<p class='c009'>Have the oven very hot (about 400 or 450 degrees), and
place the meat in it. Watch closely, and as soon as the
flour in the pan turns dark brown pour in enough boiling
water to cover the bottom of the pan. The flour may brown
in five minutes, yet it may take ten or more for this process,
the time depending upon the bottom of the oven. When
the meat is brown on one side, baste well, and turn it over
to brown the other side. When the meat has been in the
oven for about thirty minutes, close the draughts to reduce
the heat of the oven.</p>

<p class='c009'>Baste the meat every fifteen minutes in this manner.
With a long spoon, dip up the liquid from the bottom of the
pan and pour it over the meat. Continue this until nearly
all has been absorbed by the meat; then dredge lightly with
salt, pepper, and flour. Now pour into the pan enough hot
water to cover the bottom. The last time the meat is basted
omit putting the water in the pan, and at the end of fifteen
minutes all the liquid will be evaporated. Now take up the
meat and place it on a hot platter. Take out the rack, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>then pour all the fat from the pan into a cup. Put half a
pint of hot water in the pan and set on top of the range.
Scrape all the sediment from the sides and bottom, and
thicken this gravy with a teaspoonful of flour smoothly
mixed with a gill of cold water. Season with salt and pepper,
and simmer for two minutes; then strain into a hot
dish and serve with the roast meat.</p>

<p class='c009'>The time of cooking a roast depends upon the shape in
which it is cut and whether it is to be rare or well done.
The rule of so many minutes for each pound is not a good
one; for a long, thin, rib roast might weigh just the same
as a short, thick piece cut from the round, rump, or
shoulder, and, of course, the thin piece would cook much
more quickly than the short thick piece.</p>

<p class='c009'>A leg of mutton weighing eight or nine pounds should be
cooked for an hour and three quarters, if to be served rare;
if to be medium rare, two hours, but if well done (a pity it
should ever be!) two hours and a quarter. Half a leg of
mutton, weighing about four pounds, should be cooked for
an hour and a quarter. The meat will be rare.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Roast Rib of Beef.</h3>

<p class='c011'>For three persons one rib will be enough. Wipe the meat
with a damp towel. Place a meat-rack in a dripping-pan
and lay the beef on it. Dredge with salt, pepper, and flour,
turning the meat over in order that every part shall receive
a portion of the coating. Dredge the bottom of the pan
lightly with the flour and salt. Set the pan in a very hot
oven, and watch carefully to prevent the flour on the bottom
of the pan from burning. When the flour turns dark brown,
pour in enough water to cover the bottom of the pan; this
will be in from two to five minutes after the pan is placed
in the oven. After the water has been added let the meat
cook awhile, and then baste it. To baste, draw the pan out
of the oven and tip it a little, that all the gravy shall flow to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>one end of the pan. With a long-handled spoon, dip up
this gravy and pour it over the meat. Continue this until
the entire piece is well moistened. Now dredge the meat
lightly with salt, pepper, and flour. Pour into the pan
enough boiling water to cover the bottom, and return to the
oven. At the end of a quarter of an hour draw the pan out
again, turn the meat over, and baste as before. Add some
water and then set the pan in the oven. Now reduce the
heat by shutting the draughts, and baste every fifteen minutes
in the manner described. Do not use any water the
last time. The meat should cook in all one hour if wanted
rather rare. When the beef is done, take it up and place it
on a warm dish. Pour all the fat from the dripping-pan,
and, after setting the pan on the range, pour into it half a
pint of boiling water. Scrape all the brown sediment from
the sides and bottom of the pan. Mix one teaspoonful of
flour with three tablespoonfuls of cold water, and gradually
pour this mixture into the dripping-pan, stirring all the
while. It may not take all the mixture of flour and water
to thicken the gravy. Stop when the gravy is about as
thick as cream. Season with salt and pepper, and strain
into a hot bowl.</p>

<p class='c009'>If all this work be properly done, the beef will be rare
and juicy, and the gravy rich, brown, and smooth.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Roast Lamb.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Lamb, being immature meat, should be rather well done.
The spring lambs are so small that a leg will not make a
burdensome roast in a small family. The loin and breast
make good small roasts. Roast the lamb according to the
rule given for roast rib of beef. Serve with the made
gravy and mint sauce. Asparagus, peas, young beets, summer
squash, and any delicate summer vegetable, may be
served with lamb.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>Roast Mutton.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Mutton is roasted like beef. For a small roast the loin
or breast is good. A leg of mutton may be cut into two
parts, using one for a roast and the other for steaming.
Mutton should always be cooked rare and served hot.
Currant jelly should be provided with a roast. The most
appropriate vegetables are potatoes, onions, mashed turnips,
rice, squash, tomatoes in any form, sweet potatoes, Lima
beans, canned corn, etc.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Stuffed Mutton.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Make the dressing given for roast veal, substituting a generous
tablespoonful of butter for the chopped pork, and
adding also one teaspoonful of onion juice. Have the
bone removed from half of a leg of mutton. Cut deep
incisions in the inside of the leg, and press the dressing
into these. Sew up the leg, and roast the same as directed
for roast beef, cooking the meat an hour and a half. The
same vegetables as suggested for plain roast mutton are
suitable for the stuffed leg.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Roast Veal.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>5 pounds of loin or breast of veal.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 pint of stale bread.</div>
      <div class='line'>3 ounces of salt pork.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 gill of cracker crumbs.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 teaspoonful of sweet marjoram.</div>
      <div class='line'>1/2 teaspoonful of sage.</div>
      <div class='line'>Salt, pepper, flour.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>To make the dressing. Soak the bread in cold water for
two or three hours. Press out nearly all the water; then
add one ounce of salt pork chopped fine, one teaspoonful
of salt, one third of a teaspoonful of pepper, the herbs, and
crackers. Let this stand while the meat is being washed
and seasoned.</p>

<p class='c009'>The parts of the veal that are good for roasting are the
loin, breast, and fillet. Veal requires a great deal of seasoning,
and is almost always stuffed. It must be remembered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>that in the loin and breast there is a great deal of bone.
On the other hand, the fillet has not a particle of waste
except a small bit of round bone. Veal is delicious cold,
and the cold roast meat can be prepared in many savory
ways. For these reasons, if the family do not object to the
meat in all forms, it would be well to get a roast of good
size. This is a kind of meat that must be thoroughly
done; not even a pinkish tinge should be seen after it
is cooked.</p>

<p class='c009'>For a family of three get a loin or breast weighing
about four or five pounds. Wash it in cold water and wipe
it with a clean towel. Rub into it one tablespoonful of
salt, and sprinkle lightly with pepper. Stuff it, roll it up,
and skewer it. Place on a rack in the dripping-pan, and
lay upon it two ounces of salt pork cut in thin slices. Cook
for two hours and a half, following the directions given for
roasting.</p>

<p class='c009'>Any of the following named vegetables may be served
with roast veal: potatoes, rice, macaroni, spinach, asparagus,
beets, turnips, parsnips, salsify, string beans, shell
beans, grated horseradish, etc.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Roast Pork.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The piece termed the sparerib is the best for roasting.
Wipe the meat with a damp towel. Season it with salt,
pepper, and sage, using a teaspoonful of powdered sage to
four pounds of pork. Follow the directions for roast rib of
beef, cooking a four or five pound roast for two hours. Any
of the following named vegetables may be served with roast
pork: white potatoes, sweet potatoes, rice, hominy, squash,
turnips, onions, etc.; and apple sauce always is desirable.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Roast Ham.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Prepare the ham the same as for boiled ham; boiling it
for only three hours, however, and baking it slowly for
three hours more.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>BROILING.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>There are several modes of broiling: over clear coals,
before the coals, or under a bed of coals; also under a
sheet of flame, as in a gas stove. No matter what the fuel
may be or the mode of broiling, the principles are the
same. A steak or chop, properly broiled, should have a
thin, well browned crust. Beyond this crust the meat should
be red and juicy; hardly a shade rarer at the centre than
near the surface. A common mode of cooking a steak is
to keep it over the coals until one side is rather well done;
then turn it, and treat the other side in the same manner.
The result of following this method is, that as far as the
heat has penetrated the meat is hard and dry, and if the

<div class='ic001'>
<p>DOUBLE-BROILER.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>If the broiling is to be done on a range have the fire
very bright and clear. Open every draught, that smoke
and flame may be drawn up the chimney.
Place the piece of meat in the
double-broiler, and hold it as near the
coals as possible until the surface is
brown, turning frequently. It will take
three or four minutes for this. Now
raise the broiler several inches above
the bed of coals, and continue the
cooking until the meat is done. The
broiler must be turned often. A good
rule is to count ten slowly, then turn the broiler. A steak or
chop, cut a little more than an inch thick, will cook rare in
ten minutes; if liked medium well done, it should be cooked
for twelve minutes. A chicken weighing about three pounds
will require slow broiling for half an hour; or the chicken
may be broiled over the fire until a rich brown,—say about
fifteen minutes,—then put it in a shallow pan in a moderate
oven for about twenty minutes.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>Veal and pork must be broiled slowly until cooked thoroughly.
Chops or cutlets cut about half an inch thick will
cook in twelve minutes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Steaks and chops which, before cooking, are dredged
lightly with salt, pepper, and flour, will be much richer
than those cooked without any seasoning. Both steaks and
chops should be served the minute they come from the
fire. Season them with salt and butter. Never put them
in the oven for the purpose of melting the butter. It spoils
the dish. If a steak or chop must wait a little time before
it is served, keep it warm, but do not add the butter until
serving time.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>To Broil in a Frying-pan.</h3>

<p class='c011'>It sometimes happens that one has no means of broiling
over coals or under heat. The next best thing is broiling in
a pan. For example, have a steak cut about an inch thick.
After making a frying-pan very hot, sprinkle in some fine
salt, and lay the steak in the pan. Cook for two minutes;
then lift the steak up and sprinkle the pan with salt. Turn
the steak and cook for two minutes. Cook the piece of
meat ten minutes in all, turning every two minutes. Put
the meat on a hot dish, and season with salt and butter.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Broiled Chops with Bacon.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Bacon that is to be broiled should be boneless and fat,
and the slices should be about as thin as the blade of a
knife. The bars of the broiler should be very close, what
is called an oyster broiler being best.</p>

<p class='c009'>Place the slices of bacon in the broiler and over a clean
fire, having all the draughts open. Cook the meat for
about four minutes, turning constantly. The fat will blaze
up continually, but will not hurt the bacon if that be turned
all the while. Put the cooked bacon on a hot plate, and
keep warm until the chops are cooked.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>If the chops be cut an inch thick, cook them for nine
minutes, turning almost continually. Season with salt and
pepper, and place on a hot dish. Lay a slice of bacon on
each chop, and arrange the remainder around the dish.
Serve hot and on hot plates.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Beefsteak and Onions.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Steak for broiling.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 pint of sliced onions.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 level teaspoonful of salt.</div>
      <div class='line'>3 tablespoonfuls of butter or drippings.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Pare and slice the onions. Put them in a stewpan with
two quarts of boiling water and cook for fifteen minutes.
Drain off all the water. Put the butter or drippings in a
frying-pan and add the drained onions. Cover the frying-pan
and place on the range. Cook for half an hour, being
careful not to burn. Stir the onions frequently. Broil the
steak rare and lay it on the bed of onions for five minutes,
having the pan covered; then place the steak on a hot
dish, and arrange the onions around it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The onions need not be boiled, if a strong flavor be
liked.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>FRYING.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The word “frying” may mean either of two modes of
cooking food: using a common frying-pan, with only a
small amount of fat, or immersing the article to be cooked
in a deep kettle of hot fat.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first method is unhealthful, extravagant, and troublesome;
the second saves time and is more economical and
healthful. When a housekeeper once masters this method
of frying, she will not return to the more unsatisfactory
and indigestible mode.</p>

<p class='c009'>There should be enough fat to float the article to be
cooked. The fat must be so hot as to harden the surface
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>of the article of food the moment it is immersed, making it
impervious to the fat or the juices contained in the food
itself. Different articles of food brown at different temperatures,
so that the frying temperature varies from 345°
to 400° Fahrenheit. Most mixtures composed in part of
flour, sugar, milk, or eggs—like fritter batters, doughnuts,
etc.—may be cooked at 350°; whereas such articles as
oysters, white-bait, croquettes, etc., require a heat of at
least 400°. French fried and thin fried potatoes need ten
minutes’ cooking. The fat must have a temperature of
about 370° when they are put into it, because the potatoes
should stand in ice-water for some time before they are
cooked. Moisture will cling to them; and this, with their
chilliness, reduces the fat at least 20° as soon as the frying
begins, making it then 350°. At this heat the potatoes
may be cooked brown and crisp in ten minutes. As already
stated, oysters require a heat of 400°. Drop a piece
of stale bread into the fat; and if the temperature be
right, the bread will become brown in half a minute. Oysters
and white-bait should be cooked brown and crisp in
one minute; longer cooking will make them rather tough
and dry. A little lower temperature—say 380°—will
do for croquettes, which should be fried for about two
minutes. If the temperature be too low, croquettes will
burst open during the cooking; particularly rice and potato
croquettes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Put the fat into a deep kettle (that called a Scotch bowl
being best) and heat it slowly. When the time for frying
the food is near at hand, set the kettle on the hottest part
of the range, and watch to see the blue smoke rise from the
centre of the surface of the liquid. The smoke indicates
the temperature to be about 350°. Drop a piece of stale
bread into the fat; and if one minute be required to brown
it, the fat may be used at once for frying muffins, doughnuts,
fritters, breaded chops, and indeed nearly all articles
that require three or four minutes’ cooking.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>How to keep Fat.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>When the frying has been finished, take the fat from the
fire and let it cook slightly. Next place a piece of cheese-cloth
in a colander or strainer, and, after setting this over a
jar or pail, strain the fat through the cloth. This straining
never should be omitted; for, with good care, the same fat
may be used many times.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>The Kind of Fat to use.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Olive oil would be the best liquid to use if the matter of
expense were not to be considered. Any pure, clear fat
that is free of strong odor will answer. Many folk use mutton
and ham fat, and say that they do not find the flavor of
the meat in the articles fried; but others would discover
the taste at once, and consider it disagreeable.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the housekeeper will select the material she will use
according to her taste and means; and attention may as
well be turned now to the conditions which will insure satisfactory
and comparatively wholesome fried food. In the
first place, the fat must be perfectly clarified. Even the
purest and sweetest butter must go through this process
before being used for frying. Oil and lard, when pure,
already are clarified. When the fat to be clarified is that
which has been skimmed from gravies, soups, or the water
in which corned beef has been boiled, it will contain water
and other impurities. While there is water in fat the latter
cannot be heated to a temperature suitable for frying purposes;
and if there be other foreign substances present,
such as particles of meat, gravy, flour, or starch, they will
burn at as high a temperature as 345°, blackening the fat
and making it unfit for frying articles of food.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>The Frying Basket.</h3>

<p class='c011'>While it is possible to fry food in deep fat without the
use of the frying basket, that invention will be found a most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>valuable aid in this branch of cookery. The basket is
made of fine wire, and has a bail across the top. Do not
get one of coarse wire and open meshes.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id015'>
<img src='images/p127.png' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>THE WAY TO LOWER THE FRYING BASKET.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>After the articles to be fried have been put into it, it
should be lowered into the fat; gently, because the particles
of moisture which cling to the food are instantly converted
into steam, and this would expand beneath the
surface and force some of the fat from the kettle if the
basket were lowered quickly. The operation may be performed
safely by hanging the basket on a long spoon or
fork, and then letting it settle gently in the fat. Do not
crowd into the basket the articles that are to be fried.
When the food has been cooked as long as seems necessary,
lift the basket with the spoon or fork, and, after allowing the
fat to drip from it, place it on a plate. Remove the cooked
articles, and lay them on brown paper that has been spread
on a warm pan. If properly cooked, they will hardly stain
the paper.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Breaded Chops.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Mutton or lamb chops may be breaded and served with
tomato or brown sauce. Have the chops cut an inch thick.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>Trim them, and season with salt and pepper. Dip them
in beaten egg and roll in dry bread crumbs. Lay them in
deep fat for six minutes if they are to be rare done, and
for ten minutes if to be well done. Slices from the leg may
be prepared in the same manner.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Breaded Veal Cutlets.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>

the bread crumbs. Fry them in deep fat for ten minutes.
Serve with tomato or brown sauce.</p>

<p class='c009'>If you prefer, the cutlets may be fried in pork fat. In
that case fry two ounces of fat salt pork. Take up the pork
and put the cutlets into the fat remaining in the pan.

      <div class='line'>1-1/2 tablespoonfuls of flour.</div>
      <div class='line'>2 quarts of boiling water.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Have the butcher cut the bone into six parts. Wash the
shank carefully, being sure to remove any particles of meat
or gristle that are not perfectly sweet. They will be found
at the small end, if at all. Put the shin in a stewpan with
the onion, carrot, bay leaf, parsley, clove, salt, pepper, and
water.</p>

<p class='c009'>Place the stewpan on the fire, and when its contents
begin to boil, skim the liquid carefully, and set the pan
back where the meat will only simmer for six hours. At
the end of five hours and a half, dip out one pint of the
liquid; and after allowing this partially to cool, skim off
the fat.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>Put the butter in a saucepan and place it on the stove.
When the butter begins to bubble, add the flour, and stir
the mixture until it is smooth and brown; then gradually
add three gills of the cold liquid. Cook for three minutes,
stirring all the time. Season with salt and pepper, and set
back where it will keep hot.</p>

<p class='c009'>Take up the meat, removing it from the bones; also
remove the marrow from the bones. Put the meat and
marrow into the stewpan with the sauce. Draw the pan
forward and let its contents boil up once. Serve on a hot
dish with a garnish of potato cubes.</p>

<p class='c009'>The remainder of the liquor in which the shin was boiled
may be used for a soup the next day.</p>

<p class='c009'>To prepare the potatoes, pare raw ones, and cut them
into inch cubes. Put these in a stewpan, and cover with
boiling water. Cook them for fifteen minutes, counting
from the time the cover is placed on the stewpan. At the
end of that time pour off all the water and sprinkle salt
over the potatoes,—half a teaspoonful to a pint of the
cubes. Place the stewpan on the fire for about one minute;
then shake well. For three persons cook a pint and a half
of cubes.</p>

Cook the meat in this manner for thirty minutes.
Now add a gill of boiling water, and draw the stewpan to a
part of the range where the contents will cook slowly for
four hours. Add a gill of boiling water whenever the liquid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>in the stewpan becomes low. When the meat has been
cooking for three hours, mix the flour smoothly with a gill
of cold water, and turn into the gravy in the stewpan. Add
enough boiling water now to make the full pint; the whole
clove also may be added. Cook the meat an hour longer;
then serve on a warm platter, with a part of the gravy
poured over it. Serve the remainder of the gravy in a

the fat remaining in the pan, cook slowly for fifteen minutes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Rub half the pepper and two teaspoonfuls of the salt
into the piece of meat, and place it in a deep granite-ware
pan. When the vegetables are cooked, put them with the
meat, first pressing from them as much fat as possible.
Into the fat remaining in the pan put the flour, and stir
until it becomes a dark brown. Add the water gradually,
stirring all the while. Season this gravy with the remainder
of the salt and pepper, and boil for five minutes; then
pour over the meat in the pan. Add the cloves and parsley.
Cover the pan and set in a very moderate oven. Cook for
five hours, basting every half-hour with the gravy in the
pan. The oven must never be so hot that the gravy will
bubble.</p>

<p class='c009'>This long, slow cooking will make the toughest piece of
meat tender; but if it be cooked too fast, the meat will become
hard, dry, and stringy. Any of the tough pieces can
be used for this dish.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>Veal, mutton, chicken, and turkey all can be cooked in

<p class='c009'>Take the bones and the tough pieces left from a cold
roast of beef. After cutting all the meat from the bones,
remove all the fat from the meat and put it on the fire in a
frying-pan. Cut the lean meat into small pieces. Place
the bones in a stewpan and lay the meat on top of them.
Take from the frying-pan five tablespoonfuls of liquid fat
and put it in another frying-pan. Add the minced vegetables,
and cook slowly for half an hour. At the end of
that time draw the pan forward to a hotter part of the
range and cook rapidly for three minutes, stirring all the
time. Now draw the vegetables to one side of the pan and
press out the fat, then put the vegetables in the stewpan.
Put the flour into the fat remaining in the pan, and stir
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>until it becomes smooth and brown; then add the water,
and stir until it boils. Add the salt and pepper and cook
for three minutes. Pour this gravy into the stewpan, and,
covering the pan, set it back where the contents will just
bubble at one side for two hours and a half. The potatoes
are then to be added and the stewpan brought forward to
a hotter place. At the end of half an hour the stew will
be done. Remove the bones and serve the stew on a
warm dish. It may be garnished with a circle of small
baking powder biscuit, or with dumplings.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Stew from Cold Lamb or Mutton.</h3>

<p class='c011'>With the bones and tough pieces of cold lamb or mutton
a stew can be made the same as beef stew with cold roast
beef. If you have the small white turnips use a gill of these
cut in cubes and fried with the other vegetables.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Veal Olives.</h3>

<p class='c011'>In making veal olives use a tablespoonful of butter in the

pan and lay the slices of veal in the hot fat. Let them fry
until they have a good brown color, turning them when
brown on one side. Take up the veal and stir the remainder
of the flour into the fat. When the flour is brown, add
the cold water, stirring all the time. When this gravy
boils up put the browned veal into it and simmer for half
an hour. Add the tomatoes and boil up once.</p>

<p class='c009'>The flavor and appearance of this dish may be varied by
changing the gravy. Measure the water generously, and
omit the tomatoes, and you have a simple brown fricassee.
Be scant in the measurement of water and tomatoes, adding
the tomatoes to the gravy when the meat is put in; then,
at the end of half an hour, add a gill of milk, and boil up
once, and you have a bisque of veal. Or you may omit
the tomatoes, and at the end of the half-hour add a generous
gill of milk, and you have a white fricassee. In this
case do not brown the flour when it is added to the fat.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>Have the mutton free from bones. Cut off all the fat

six minutes. Take the meat from the fat and put it into a
stewpan. Put the turnips, carrots, and onion in the fat remaining
in the pan and cook for ten minutes, being careful
not to brown them. Press all the fat from the vegetables
and put them in the stewpan with the meat. Now, after
pouring all the fat from the pan, put in the butter and flour,

then draw back to a cooler place and gradually stir in one
pint and a half of water. When this boils up add it to
the contents of the stewpan.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mix the salt, pepper, corn-starch, and a gill of cold water.

minutes; then add the milk and cold meat, and simmer
gently for fifteen minutes. Turn out on a warm dish and
garnish with rice, toast, or pastry cakes. A teaspoonful
of lemon juice, added just as the blanquette is being
removed from the fire, is an addition that pleases most
tastes. A teaspoonful of curry-powder may be stirred
into the butter when the flour is added, thus changing
the dish to a delicate curry.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Pork Chops.</h3>

<h3 class='c010'>Fried Salt Pork.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Have the slices cut about one fourth of an inch thick.

cook more rapidly until they are crisp and brown. Draw
the pan back, and, taking up the pork, arrange it on a hot

with salt and pepper and roll it in the flour. Put the drippings

Take up the tripe, and into the fat remaining in the pan
scrape such part of the flour as did not adhere to the tripe.
Stir the mixture, and then add the cold water or milk.
Cook for two minutes. Taste, to see if seasoned enough,
because more salt and pepper may be needed. Strain this
gravy over the tripe, and serve. If any one of the following
named seasonings be liked it may be added to the gravy:
half a teaspoonful of onion juice, one tablespoonful of
tomato catsup, one teaspoonful of lemon juice, or one teaspoonful
of vinegar.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Hash of Fresh Meat.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Any kind of meat can be used to make a meat-and-potato
hash; but, of course, nothing is so good as corned beef.
Cold roast, boiled, or broiled beef, mutton, lamb, veal, or
tongue can be freed from skin, fat, and bones, seasoned
highly with salt and pepper, and cooked like corned beef
hash. Even two or three kinds of meat can be used. If
it happens that you have a bit of steak, a part of a chop,
and perhaps a slice of tongue, use them all.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>Use any kind of cooked unsalted meat, and have it free
from skin, bones, and fat. Put it in a stewpan. Put the
vegetables and butter in a frying-pan, and cook for ten

<h3 class='c010'>How to Clean and Truss Poultry.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Cut off the head, and then the legs, being careful in the
latter case to cut in or below the joints. Now cut the skin
on the back of the neck; then turn the skin over on the
breast and cut off the neck. Take out the crop, being particular
to remove all the lining membrane. Put the forefinger
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>into the throat and break the ligaments that hold the
internal organs to the breastbone. Next cut the bird open
at the vent, beginning under the left leg, and cutting in
a slanting direction toward the vent. Stop there. Insert
the hand in this opening, and work around the organs until
they are loosened from the bones. Gently draw all the
organs out at once. Put the hand in to learn if either the
windpipe or lights are left in the body. Cut the oil bag
from the tail. This is a hard, yellow substance. Now
singe the bird by holding it over a lighted newspaper. The
paper should be drawn into a long, fluffy piece, then twisted
lightly. Hold the burning paper over an open fire or a
coal hod during the operation of singeing.</p>

<p class='c009'>Wash the poultry quickly in cold water; then season it
with salt, and fill the crop and breast with dressing. Draw
the skin at the neck on to the back, and fasten it with a
skewer to the backbone. Turn the tips of the wings under
the back, and fasten them in that position with a long
skewer. Pass a short skewer through the lower part of the
legs, and then through the tail. Tie with long piece of
twine. Turn the bird on its breast and bring the string
up around the skewers that hold the neck and wings. Tie
firmly, and the bird will be ready for cooking.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Boiled Fowl.</h3>

<p class='c011'>A boiled fowl is one of the most satisfactory and economical
dishes of poultry. The meat can be used in making
a great variety of dishes, and the water in which the fowl
was boiled may be used in soups, or for the foundation of
meat, fish, and vegetable sauces.</p>

<p class='c009'>Select a short, plump, fat fowl. Singe and draw it, and
wash it quickly in cold water. Put it in a stewpan, breast
down, with boiling water enough to cover it. When the
water begins to boil, skim thoroughly; then draw the stewpan
back, where the water will bubble at one side of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>pan, until the fowl is tender. This you can tell by pressing
the wing back with a fork. If it breaks away from the
breast readily, the fowl is cooked enough. Take the stewpan
from the fire, and set it, with the cover off, in a cool,
airy place. When cool, take up the fowl and put it away.
Pour the water into a large bowl and set in a cool place
for future use.</p>

<p class='c009'>If the fowl is to be served hot, take it up when tender,
place it on a platter and pour over it a little butter, Béchamel,
or parsley sauce. Serve the remainder of the sauce
in a gravy bowl.</p>

<p class='c009'>If the fowl is to be served hot for dinner, boil four ounces
of mixed salt pork with it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The time of boiling a fowl cannot be given, because it
depends upon the age. A fowl about a year old will cook
in two hours; one two or three years old may take three or
four hours.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cold boiled fowl may be used for a fricassee, blanquette,
salad, pie, creamed chicken, croquettes, etc.</p>

<p class='c009'>Have all the materials for the dressing mixed together in
a bowl, cutting the butter into small bits. Remember that
there is no liquid used in this dressing. Clean the chicken
and stuff the crop and body with the dressing. Truss the
chicken and dredge it with salt. Rub soft butter over the
breast and legs, and dredge thickly with flour. Place a
rack in the dripping-pan, and, after laying the chicken on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>it, put in half a pint of hot water. Set the pan in a hot
oven and baste the chicken every fifteen minutes, pouring
over it the gravy in the dripping-pan until every part is
well moistened, and then dredging lightly with salt, pepper,
and flour. At the last basting omit the gravy, and moisten
instead with a tablespoonful of butter dissolved in a tablespoonful
of hot water; then dredge lightly with flour.
After the first half-hour the heat of the oven should be
reduced. It will take an hour and a half to cook a chicken
weighing four or five pounds. If the tin kitchen be used,
the chicken should be prepared and basted in the same
manner, but it will take fifteen minutes longer to cook it.

Pour this sauce back into the saucepan; cover, and set
back where it will keep hot.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the chicken is cooked, pour the gravy from the

chicken. Fry the chicken brown on all sides. It will take
about half an hour to cook it. When it is done, arrange it
on a warm platter. Put the butter with the fat remaining
in the pan, and add all the flour that did not cling to the
chicken, stirring until smooth and frothy. Gradually add

a rolling-pin crush it lightly; for about two thirds of the
bread, when done, should be in the form of coarse crumbs.
Measure out half a cupful of these crumbs, and, putting
them in the flour sieve, rub all the fine crumbs through.
Put these fine crumbs in the double-boiler with the milk
and onion. Place on the fire and cook for half an hour.
At the end of that time take out the onion, and add the

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XII.<br /> <br />SALADS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c005'>A SALAD should be light, fresh, and crisp; no matter
what it is made of, it should never be “mussy.”
Much decoration or handling will produce a heavy-looking
dish.</p>

<p class='c009'>Celery, lettuce, tomatoes, etc. should be thoroughly chilled
before being combined in a salad. All meats and fish that
are to be served in a salad must be seasoned with salt, pepper,
vinegar, and oil before being combined with the green
vegetable and the dressing. It is well to have this seasoning
added several hours before the salad is to be served.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Mayonnaise Dressing.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1/2 pint of olive oil.</div>

      <div class='line'>1/2 teaspoonful of sugar.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 tablespoonful of lemon juice.</div>
      <div class='line'>2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar.</div>
      <div class='line'>Yolks of two uncooked eggs.</div>
      <div class='line'>A grain of cayenne.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Put the yolks of the eggs into a bowl, being careful not
to let any of the white go in. Add the dry ingredients to
the yolks, and place the bowl in a flat pan. Put a little
cold water and ice in the pan. Beat these ingredients until
light and thick; then begin to add the oil, a few drops at a
time. Beat well between each addition of oil. When the
mixture gets thick and ropy, a larger quantity of oil may
be added each time. When the dressing is so thick that
the beater turns hard, add a few drops of vinegar to thin
it. When all the other ingredients have been used add
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>the lemon juice, and beat for a few minutes longer. This
sauce will keep for three or four weeks, if covered and
kept in a cool place.</p>

<p class='c009'>The secret of success in making a Mayonnaise dressing is
to have everything cold, to beat the yolks of eggs and dry
ingredients until thick, and at first to add the oil only in
drops. It is also essential that the beating should be regular,
and always in one direction.</p>

<p class='c009'>If a milder flavor of the oil be liked, a gill of whipped
cream may be stirred into the dressing when it is about to
be used.</p>

boiling water. Beat constantly with an egg-beater until the
dressing becomes thick and light. Take from the fire at
once, and turn into a cold bowl to prevent curdling; or the
bowl in which it was cooked may be placed in a pan of ice
water, and the mixture be stirred until cool.</p>

<p class='c009'>Beat the cream to a thick froth, and stir it into the cold
dressing. If you have no cream stir a tablespoonful of butter

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XIII.<br /> <br />VEGETABLES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c005'>ALL vegetables should be put in boiling water when set
on the stove to cook. Peas, asparagus, potatoes, and
all delicately flavored vegetables should be only covered
with water, but those with a strong flavor, like carrots, turnips,
cabbage, onions, and dandelions, should be cooked in
a generous quantity of boiling water. All green vegetables
should be cooked with the cover partially off the stewpan.
It gives them a better color and a more delicate flavor.</p>

<p class='c009'>The average housekeeper is careless as to the time of
cooking vegetables, yet a vegetable is as much injured by
too much or too little cooking as is a loaf of bread or cake.
When vegetables are underdone they are hard and indigestible,
and when overdone they become dark, strong-flavored,
and indigestible.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now, although a potato will be hard if not cooked
enough, even two minutes’ cooking after the proper time
will injure it. If potatoes be covered with boiling water
and placed on the fire they will cook in thirty minutes.
If they be very small, they may get done in twenty-eight
minutes, and if they be large it may take thirty-two to cook
them sufficiently. They should be kept boiling all the time
after they once begin, but not at a furious rate, as a too
rapid boiling breaks the surface of the potato before the
centre is cooked. The time of cooking is to be counted
from the moment the boiling water is poured over the
potatoes. When the potatoes are done, the water should
be poured off and the steam allowed to escape. Should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>it be necessary to keep them warm after that, cover them
with a coarse towel, never with the pot cover; for if the
steam does not have a chance to escape it will be absorbed
by the potatoes, which will become sodden, dark,
and strong-flavored. Baked potatoes take about forty-five
minutes for cooking. A great deal depends upon the
oven. If it be necessary to keep a baked potato warm,
break it open, wrap it in a towel and put it in a warm
place.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now, as to turnips. The small white ones should be
boiled, if cut in thin slices, for thirty minutes, but if they
be cooked whole, forty minutes’ time will be needed. Yellow
turnips, when sliced, need forty-five minutes’ cooking.</p>

<p class='c009'>Carrots should be cooked for forty-five or fifty minutes;
cauliflower, only thirty minutes; with peas and asparagus
much depends upon the state of freshness and tenderness
when picked, and the time varies from twenty to thirty-five
minutes; indeed, peas sometimes require fifty minutes’
cooking.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is a pity that it is the fashion to serve such vegetables
as peas and asparagus in a sauce. They have so delicate
a flavor that only a little salt and good butter should be
added to them. This is true, also, of turnips. Cauliflower,
onions, and carrots, however, need a sauce.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Boiled Potatoes.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Pare five or six potatoes and let them stand in cold water
for an hour or more. Forty minutes before dinner time
put them in a kettle and pour boiling water over them,—enough
to cover. Put the cover on the kettle and cook
the vegetables for half an hour, counting from the moment
the water is poured over them. When they have been
cooking for fifteen minutes, add one teaspoonful of salt.
At the end of the half-hour pour off all the water and set
the pan on the back part of the range. Cover the potatoes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>with a clean, coarse towel. At serving time put the potatoes
in a hot dish, and cover with a napkin. Never put
the china cover on the dish. Cooked in the way described,
the potatoes will be mealy and have a fine flavor.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Boiled Sweet Potatoes.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Potatoes of medium size should be cooked for one hour;
very large ones should be boiled for an hour and a half, or
be cut into several parts.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Baked Sweet Potatoes.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Wash the potatoes and bake from an hour to an hour
and a quarter in a moderately hot oven. The longer they
bake, the sweeter and moister they will be.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>Browned Sweet Potatoes.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Boil for half an hour three potatoes of medium size.
On taking them from the water pare them. Now cut
them in two, lengthwise, and lay them in the pan under
a piece of roasting meat. Season them with salt, and let
them cook for half an hour. Serve in a hot dish.</p>

<p class='c009'>Or, the potatoes may be boiled for three quarters of an
hour, paired and split, then laid in a baking pan, seasoned
with salt, and finally spread with soft butter. It
will take one tablespoonful of butter for three potatoes.
Bake in a hot oven for twenty minutes or half an hour.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Warming over Sweet Potatoes.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Cold boiled sweet potatoes may be warmed in several
ways. Cut them in halves, season with salt, and put in the
frying-basket. Fry in deep fat for five minutes; then season
with salt and serve.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another way is to cut them in thick slices lengthwise, dip
them in melted butter, season with salt and pepper, dredge
lightly with flour, and broil over clear coals. Serve on a hot
dish.</p>

<p class='c009'>Still another mode is to cut them in round slices, season
with salt and pepper, and fry in pork or bacon fat.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Boiled Onions.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Put the onions in a saucepan with plenty of boiling
water and cook for one hour. If milk be plentiful, pour off
the water when the onions have been cooking for half an
hour, and add just enough hot milk to cover them. Simmer
for half an hour longer; then season with salt, pepper, and
butter, and serve.</p>

<p class='c009'>For half a dozen small onions use one tablespoonful of
butter, one teaspoonful of salt, and one fourth of a teaspoonful
of pepper.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>Creamed Onions.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Boil three or four onions for one hour in two quarts of
boiling water into which one teaspoonful of salt has been
sprinkled. Pour off the water and cut up the onions. Put
them in a hot dish and pour half a pint of cream sauce over
them. Serve hot.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Onions au Gratin.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Prepare the creamed onions and put them in an escalop
dish. Cover them with a gill of grated bread crumbs and
dot with a teaspoonful of butter. Bake for twenty minutes
in a quick oven.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Sliced Tomatoes.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Select smooth, ripe tomatoes. Drop them into boiling
water for one minute, then into cold water. This will make
the skin come off easily. Put them on a plate and in a cool
place,—on the ice if possible. At serving time cut them in
slices and place on a cold dish.</p>

<p class='c009'>Put all the ingredients, except the butter, in a stewpan,
and cook for twenty minutes. Add the butter, and cook
for ten minutes longer.</p>

<p class='c009'>One pint of fresh tomatoes may be cooked in the same
manner. The crackers may be omitted. Long cooking
makes the tomatoes thicker and dark, but for most tastes
this is not desirable.</p>

      <div class='line'>1-1/2 teaspoonfuls of butter.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Reserve the grated bread crumbs and half a teaspoonful
of the butter. Mix all the other ingredients together and
turn into a small baking dish. Sprinkle the grated bread
crumbs over this. Cut the butter into small bits, and
sprinkle over the crumbs. Bake in a moderately hot oven
for half an hour, and serve hot.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Beets.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Beets, when young and fresh, will cook in forty minutes,
but as they grow larger they require longer cooking. The
time has to be increased as the season advances, and in
winter beets require from two to three hours’ boiling.
Wash them in cold water, being careful not to break the
skin or little tendrils. Put them in boiling water and cook
until done,—the time depending upon the season. Lay
them in cold water and rub off the skin; then slice them
into a hot dish, and season with salt and butter. Serve hot.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Boiled Turnips.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1 quart of white turnip cubes.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 tablespoonful of butter.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 level tablespoonful of sugar.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 heaped teaspoonful of salt.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Pare and cut up enough of the small flat white turnips to
make one quart. Let them stand in cold water for an hour
or more. Pour off all the water and turn the turnips into a
stewpan containing two quarts of boiling water. Cook for
just thirty minutes and then pour off all the water. Put into
the saucepan with the turnips, butter, sugar, salt, and one
gill of boiling water. Place the saucepan on the hottest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>part of the fire and cook the turnips rapidly until all the
liquid has been absorbed, shaking the pan frequently to
prevent the turnips from burning. Turn into a hot dish
and serve.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Mashed Turnips.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Pare one yellow turnip or six white ones and cut in slices.
Put in a large stewpan with a generous supply of boiling
water. If white turnips be used, cook them for half an
hour; but if the yellow kind be taken, cook for fifty or sixty
minutes. Too little water and too much cooking will make
any turnips’ strong-flavored, and give them a dark color.
When the turnips are done, drain off all the water and mash
them well. Season with salt, pepper, and butter.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Boiled Carrots.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Scrape and cut into cubes enough raw carrots to make a
quart. Cook them for one hour in three quarts of boiling
water, and then proceed as directed in the rule for boiled
turnips. White stock may be substituted for the gill of
boiling water.</p>

<p class='c009'>Turnips, carrots, and green peas, cooked in this manner,
and then mixed together, make a handsome and savory
dish.</p>

<p class='c009'>Success in cooking these vegetables depends upon their
being boiled in plenty of water, and for only the time mentioned;
also in cooking very rapidly after the seasonings are
added.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Parsnips.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Scrape and slice the parsnips, and let them stand in cold
water for an hour or more. Drain them and put them in
a stewpan with plenty of boiling water. Cook them, if fresh,
for forty-five minutes; but if they have been out of the ground
any length of time they will require an hour’s cooking.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>When they have been boiling for half an hour, add a teaspoonful
of salt for about a pint of the parsnips. Drain,
and season them with salt and butter; or, pour a butter or
Béchamel sauce over them.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Salsify.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Remove the leaves from the cauliflower, and place it head

of salt. Let it stand in a cold place an hour or
more. Have about three quarts of boiling water in a stewpan
and put the cauliflower into it head down. Cover, and
cook gently for thirty minutes. At the end of this time
drain the cauliflower and put it in a deep dish. Dredge
lightly with salt, and pour the sauce over it.</p>

the pork in the stewpan with the beans, and simmer until the
beans begin to crack open,—not a minute longer. Drain all
the water from them and rinse with cold water. Put the
onion in the bottom of the bean pot. Put about half the
beans in the pot, then put in the pork, having the scored
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>side up. Next put in the remainder of the beans. Mix the
mustard, salt, pepper, sugar, and molasses with a pint of
boiling water and pour over the beans. Add just enough
boiling water to cover the beans. Cover the pot and place
in a slow oven. Bake for ten hours or more, adding boiling
water whenever the beans look dry. The oven must
never be hot enough to make the water on the beans bubble,
and there should never be more water in the pot than will
barely come to the top of the beans.</p>

<p class='c009'>An earthen pot should be used in baking beans. The
onion and molasses may be omitted.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Green Peas.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The time of cooking green peas depends upon the age
and the length of time they have been picked. If they be
young and freshly picked, they will cook in twenty minutes;
but it may take forty or fifty if they have matured too much,
or have been picked for a day or more. They should not
be shelled many hours before they are cooked. Wash the
pea pods and drain them, then shell them. Put them in a
stewpan with just enough boiling water to cover them, and
cook until tender. They must not boil rapidly, and as
soon as they begin to boil the cover of the stewpan should
be drawn a little to one side. Pour off a part of the water,
and to every pint of peas add one tablespoonful of butter
and half a teaspoonful of salt.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Canned Peas.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Cut off the tough white ends of a bunch of asparagus.
Now cut the string that ties the bundles together, and put
the asparagus in a colander. Let cold water run on it until
it is perfectly free from sand. Tie again in a bundle, and
put it in a stewpan with one tablespoonful of salt and
enough boiling water to cover it. Cook gently for half an
hour. Toast three slices of bread, and dip the edges in the
water in which the asparagus was cooked. Arrange these
on a warm platter, and spread the asparagus upon them.
Now season the green part of the vegetable with the tablespoonful
of butter, and serve.</p>

<p class='c009'>The toast may be buttered also, if one like to have it
rich.</p>

<p class='c009'>Asparagus should be placed with the cut end in a little
cold water until it is time to cook it.</p>

      <div class='line'>2 teaspoonfuls of salt.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Cut up enough of the tender ends of asparagus to make
one quart. Put these in the colander, and let cold water
run on them until every particle of sand is removed. Put
them in a saucepan with one quart of boiling water and one
teaspoonful of salt, and cook gently for half an hour; then
drain, and, after putting in a warm vegetable dish, pour the
cream sauce over them.</p>

<p class='c009'>To make the sauce, put the butter on the fire, in a pan,
and when it is melted add the flour. Stir until smooth and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>frothy; then gradually add the milk, stirring all the while.
Season with a scant teaspoonful of salt, and boil up once.</p>

<p class='c009'>If you prefer, the asparagus may be seasoned with salt and
butter, using a generous tablespoonful of butter and half a
teaspoonful of salt; moistening with a gill of the water in
which it is boiled.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Spinach.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>1 level tablespoonful of salt.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Pick over the spinach, removing all the roots and brown
leaves. Have two pans filled with cold water. Put the
spinach in one pan and wash it, a few leaves at a time,
dropping it into the second pan of water. When all is done,
turn the water from the first pan, which should at once be
rinsed and filled again with clean water. Continue washing
the spinach in this way until there is not a grain of sand
left in it. This you learn by passing the hand over the bottom
of the pan. Put the cleaned spinach in a stewpan with
a pint of boiling water and the salt, and cook for half an
hour. Turn into the colander and cut with a knife. Put
into a hot vegetable dish and add the butter.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Greens.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Greens of all kinds are cooked in about the same way
that spinach is, but they all require boiling water enough to
cover them, and most of them require a much longer time
to boil.</p>

<p class='c009'>A small piece of salt pork or smoked bacon, or a shank
of ham, is often boiled in the water for two or more hours
before the greens are put in to cook. This meat is served
with the greens, which require no seasoning except salt.</p>

<p class='c009'>Take all the green and broken leaves from a small head
of cabbage. Then divide the cabbage into eight parts, cutting
from the top down to the stalk. Wash it and let it
stand in cold water for an hour or more. Put it in a
large kettle of boiling water and boil rapidly for forty-five
minutes. The kettle must not be covered. When the
cabbage is done, drain, and put in a chopping bowl.
Mince rather fine and season with the salt and butter.
If the cabbage be fresh from the garden, half an hour’s
cooking will be sufficient.</p>

<p class='c009'>Let the cabbage stand in cold water for an hour or more;
then drain off the water and put the cabbage in a stewpan
with two quarts of boiling water. Cover, and cook for ten
minutes. At the end of that time pour off the water and

the cover off, for about three quarters of an hour. When
that time has passed, put the cabbage in a colander and
press out all the water; then cut it with a sharp knife. Put
the butter in a frying-pan and set on the range. When it
becomes hot, add the cabbage, as well as the salt and pepper.
Cook for five minutes, stirring all the time; then
cover, and set back where it will cook gently for ten

over the cabbage. Stir gently, and again cover the
pan. Cook for ten minutes more and serve.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Boiled Macaroni.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Macaroni varies as to the time it will take to cook. Half
an hour is the usual time, but it often requires forty-five

<h3 class='c010'>Boiled Eggs.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c011'>THE white and yolk should be equally well cooked in
a boiled egg, the white being soft and creamy. Put
the eggs in a deep saucepan, and pour over them a generous
amount of boiling water,—one quart or more of water
for four eggs. Cover the saucepan, and set on a part of
the range where it is so cool that the hand can rest on it
comfortably. At the end of ten minutes the eggs will be
cooked to a soft creamy consistency. If the eggs be liked
medium well done, cook for five minutes longer; if to be
hard, they may remain in the water for twenty minutes.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Poached Eggs.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Put in a frying-pan boiling water to the depth of two or
three inches. To each pint of water add a teaspoonful of
salt and a teaspoonful of vinegar. Have the water just
bubbling at one side of the pan. Break an egg close to
the pan, and drop it gently into the water. Continue putting
in eggs until you have the required number. When
the white of the egg is set, slide a cake-turner under the
egg, and lift it from the water. Slide it upon a slice of
buttered toast.</p>

<p class='c009'>In most parts of New England eggs cooked in this way
are called dropped.</p>

<p class='c009'>Muffin rings may be placed in the pan of water, and
the eggs be dropped into them. This gives a better shape.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>There are several inventions in the market by the use of
which eggs can be poached easily and successfully.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Fried Eggs.</h3>

<p class='c011'>These are usually served with ham, but they may be
served separately. Put into a pan any kind of clean
sweet fat; ham or bacon fat is generally considered as the
best. Have the fat about a quarter of an inch deep in the
pan. Break the eggs separately, and slide them gently, one
at a time, into the hot fat. With a long spoon dip up the
fat and pour over the eggs. As soon as the whites are set,
slide a cake-turner under the eggs and place them on a
warm dish. They may be arranged on slices of ham, or
the ham may be put in the centre of the dish, and the eggs
arranged around it.</p>

time put the breaded eggs in the frying basket, and plunge
into hot fat. Cook for about two minutes; then drain, and
serve on a hot dish with the bisque sauce poured around
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Put four of the eggs in a deep saucepan, and fill up with
boiling water. Cover, and let them stand on the hearth or
the coolest part of the range for twenty minutes. At the
end of this time pour off the hot water and cover with cold
water. Remove the shells and cut the eggs in two, lengthwise,
using a plated knife.</p>

<p class='c009'>Let a soup plate stand in hot water until heated through.
Put the butter, salt, and pepper in this plate, and stir until
the butter is melted. Beat the fifth egg in another soup
plate, and have a third plate filled with dry and sifted
bread crumbs. Drop the eggs, one at a time, in the melted
butter, then in the beaten egg, and finally roll them in the
crumbs. Lay them on a platter and set in a cold place

<p class='c009'>Beat the egg enough to break it well, but not to make it

<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>it. Place over a very hot fire. As soon as the butter becomes
so hot that it turns slightly brown, pour the eggs into
the pan. With the left hand lift the pan a little at the handle
side, tipping it forward slightly, so that the liquid egg
shall flow to the other side. As soon as the egg begins to
set, draw it up to the raised side of the pan. While the egg
is yet quite soft, begin to roll the omelet. Begin at the left
hand, and turn over in small folds until the lower part of the
pan is reached. Let the omelet rest a few seconds, and then
turn out on a hot dish.</p>

<p>ROLLING AN OMELET.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The work of making an omelet is very simple, but there
must be intense heat, and the work of folding and removing
from the pan must be done rapidly. Practice is essential
to perfect omelet making. The great mistake which beginners
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>usually make is, that they work too slowly, and
cook the omelet too much. It should be a soft, creamy
mass when done.</p>

hashed fine and heated in a sauce. Spread the heated
mixture on the omelet before you begin to fold it.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Fried Bread.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Cut slices of stale bread into half-inch squares. Put into
a small frying-pan or granite-ware saucepan six tablespoonfuls
of lard, and set on the fire. When the lard is so hot
that it smokes all over, put in one square of the bread. If
this becomes browned in one minute and a half, the lard is
hot enough; if it is not hot enough, make another test
very soon. Now put in the rest of the squares of bread,—there
should be about half a pint. Fry until brown, which
will be in about a minute and a half. While the bread is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>frying, stir it with a fork, in order that all parts may be
equally browned. Take from the fat with a skimmer and
drain on brown paper. When the fat has become slightly
cooled, strain it through a piece of cheese-cloth and it will
be ready to use again.</p>

<p class='c009'>This bread is to serve with tomato, pea, and other soups.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Maple Syrup from Sugar.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Break up a pound of maple sugar and put it in a saucepan

keep it in a cool, dry place for use in making syrup until
the fresh syrup comes the next year.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Mush.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Time was when the housekeeper was limited to three or
four kinds of material for mush; but that is all changed,
and the market is filled with many different preparations of
wheat, oats, corn, etc. Each new article is pronounced by
its makers to be the best. One of the principal recommendations
which each manufacturer claims for his product is
that it can be cooked in a short time. Many good articles
that are prepared for the table by the printed directions on
the package, calling for about ten minutes’ cooking, are discarded
because of unsatisfactory results, whereas if the cooking
were continued for half an hour or more the dish would
be delicious. It must be remembered that all cereals require
thorough cooking, because of the starch in them. No
matter what the cereal product may be, it should be cooked
not less than half an hour.</p>

<p class='c009'>Be sure to have the full quantity of water called for in the
receipt, and to have it boiling when the meal is stirred into
it. When dry meal is to be sprinkled into boiling water,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>stir the water briskly for a few moments before adding the
meal, and stir constantly while the meal is being sprinkled
in. Rules can be given here for only a few kinds of
cereals, but these rules can be followed in cooking almost
any one of the breakfast cereals.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>Stir the boiling water; then sprinkle in the oatmeal,
stirring all the time. After adding the salt, cover the stewpan,
and set back where the contents will cook gently for
half an hour or longer. Do not stir the mush after the first
five minutes.</p>

At the end of that time dip a small bread-pan in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>cold water, and pour the mush into it, packing smoothly.
Set away to cool.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the morning turn the mush out on a board and cut

meat.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Fried Hominy.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Cook the hominy as directed in the rule for boiled
hominy. Wet a deep dish and pour the hot hominy into
it. When cold, cut in slices about half an inch thick. Roll
the sliced hominy in flour.</p>

<p class='c009'>Put two tablespoonfuls of sweet drippings in the frying-pan
and place on the fire. When the fat is hot, lay in the
slices of hominy. Cover the pan, and cook until brown on
one side; then turn, and brown on the other. It will take
about twenty minutes’ time to brown the hominy. Serve

<p class='c009'>These cakes are good for breakfast, luncheon, or tea.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Fruit Sauces.</h3>

<p class='c011'>All kinds of fruit may be used for sauces. The juicy
fruits will require but little water, whereas the dry ones will
need a great deal. The amount of sugar used in these
fruit sauces depends upon the acidity of the fruit and the
taste of the family. If the fruit is to be kept whole, add
the sugar when the fruit is put on to stew, and cook slowly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Never cook fruit in tin.</p>

<p class='c009'>Fruit sauces that are to be served with meats should have
very little sugar added to them.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Baked Sweet Apples.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Wash and wipe the apples. Put them in a deep earthen
dish, with water enough to come up about an inch. Sprinkle
sugar over the apples and bake in a moderate oven for two
hours. Baste them twice with the water in the dish. Six
apples will require two tablespoonfuls of sugar and a scant
half-pint of water.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Baked Sour Apples.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Wash, wipe, and core six large apples, and place them in
a deep earthen dish. Fill the holes with sugar, and sprinkle

them with water; then cover the stewpan and place on
the fire. Cook until the apples are tender, and season
with sugar. The exact time of cooking and the amount
of sugar cannot be stated for any given measure of apples,
because some apples cook so much more quickly than
others, and some require more sugar.</p>

<p class='c009'>Should you wish to have the pieces of apple kept whole
in the cooking, add the sugar when the fruit is put on
to stew, and cook slowly. If, on the other hand, the apple
be liked all broken up and of light color, boil rapidly, and
sweeten after the fruit is stewed.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1 pint of cranberries.</div>
      <div class='line'>1/2 pint of granulated sugar.</div>
      <div class='line'>1/2 pint of water.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Pick over the cranberries. Wash them, and put in a
granite-ware or porcelain stewpan; then add the water
and the sugar. Cook the sauce rapidly for ten or fifteen
minutes; then turn into a bowl and set away to harden.
This gives a sauce that will jelly. If liked softer, use a
little more water.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Cranberry Jelly.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Make the same as cranberry sauce, but cook five minutes
longer; then rub through a strainer fine enough to keep
back the seeds.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Rhubarb Sauce.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Rhubarb may be stewed or baked. Pare and wash the
stalks and cut them in pieces about an inch long; then put
in a granite-ware stewpan. To a quart of the rhubarb add
one gill of sugar and one gill of water, and stew gently
until done; then turn into an earthen bowl. Another
way is to put the rhubarb, water, and sugar in an earthen
dish, cover the dish, and bake in a moderate oven for an
hour and a half.</p>

<p class='c009'>If the sauce be liked sweet more sugar may be used.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Dumplings.</h3>

then be cut into small cakes. If the dumplings are to be
cooked with the stew, set the stewpan where the contents

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XV.<br /> <br />BREAD IN VARIOUS FORMS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c005'>PERFECT bread will be light and sweet, and with a rich,
nutty flavor of the wheat. To get this result good yeast
and flour must be used; the dough, while rising, must be
kept at a proper temperature, about 75° F., and the heat
of the oven, when baking the dough, must be high enough
to raise the inside of the loaf to about 220° F. This is
necessary to cook the starch, expand the carbonic acid gas,
air, and steam, and drive off the alcohol.</p>

<p class='c009'>A good way to test the heat is to put in a piece of white
paper. If it turn a dark brown in five minutes, the oven
will be of the right temperature; but if it burn, the oven will
be too hot, and must be cooled a little before the loaf is put
in; or if the paper be only a light brown at the end of the
five minutes, the oven must be made hotter.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the bread is baked it should be cooled in such a
way that the pure air shall circulate freely around it. The
best way is to put the loaf across the pan, or to let it lean
against the pan, having it rest on its edge. In this way the
gases, alcohol, and steam pass off, making the loaf much
sweeter and crisper than when it is wrapped in a cloth.
The loaf should be perfectly cold before being put in the
bread box.</p>

<p class='c009'>When you are baking bread the heat should be greatest
when the loaf is first put in the oven; then, after cooking
for twenty-five minutes, the heat should be reduced a little.
White bread made with water should get the greater part of
its browning the first half-hour. If made with milk it will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>brown in twenty minutes; but it must be remembered that
being brown does not mean that the bread is baked.</p>

<p class='c009'>A piece of woollen blanket is of great value in making
bread. Wrap it around the bowl in which the dough is
rising, and it will keep the temperature even. Nothing is
more injurious than chilling the dough before it is risen.
It does not hurt it after it is well risen.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bread can be made with either milk or water; simply
substitute milk where water is called for. The milk should
first be boiled and cooled.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Hop Yeast.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Put a tablespoonful of hops in one quart of cold water
and place on the fire. Now pare and grate into a tin pan
three large uncooked potatoes. When the hops and water
begin to boil, strain the boiling water on the grated potatoes.
Place the pan with the potatoes and hop-water on
the stove, and stir until the mixture boils up. Take from
the fire, and add one tablespoonful of salt and two of granulated
sugar. Let this mixture stand until it is blood warm;
then add half a cupful of liquid yeast, or half a cake of compressed
yeast dissolved in one fourth of a cupful of water.
Pour the mixture into a large earthen bowl which has been
thoroughly heated. Cover, and set in a warm place for six
hours. In that time the yeast should be so well risen that
it is foamy all through. Now pour this into a stone jar, or
into two preserve jars (the jars should be not more than
half full), and put in a cold place, but not where the yeast
will freeze. This yeast will keep three or four weeks.
Made in this way it is called liquid yeast.</p>

<p class='c009'>Liquid, compressed, or dry yeast, if sweet and good,
will all make excellent bread. In very hot countries the
dry yeast is by far the best, unless one have an ice chest to
keep the liquid yeast in. As the method of making bread
with the dry yeast is different from that of making with
liquid yeast, a separate rule may be valuable.</p>

  <h3 class='c010'>Bread Made with Dry Yeast.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'><i>For three Loaves.</i></p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>2 quarts of flour.</div>
      <div class='line'>1-1/4 pints (2-1/2 cupfuls) of blood-warm water.</div>
      <div class='line'>2 tablespoonfuls of butter or lard.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 yeast cake.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 tablespoonful of sugar.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 teaspoonful of salt.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>For three small loaves there will be required two quarts
of flour, one pint and a gill of blood-warm water, one yeast
cake, one tablespoonful of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of
butter or lard, and one teaspoonful of salt.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sift the flour in the bread pan. Break up the yeast cake
and put it in a quart bowl; then add a gill of the water,
and mash with a spoon until the yeast and water are well
mixed. Beat in one gill of the flour. Cover the bowl and
set in a warm place for two hours. At the end of that time
the batter should be a perfect sponge. Add to the sponge
the pint of warm water, half the butter or lard, and the salt
and sugar. Stir this mixture into the flour and mix well
with a spoon. Sprinkle the moulding board thickly with
flour, and, turning the dough upon it, knead for twenty
minutes, using as little flour as possible. At the end of
this time the ball of dough should be soft, smooth, and
elastic. Place the dough in the bowl and rub the second
spoonful of butter or lard over it. Cover with a clean towel
and then with a tin or wood cover. Set the bowl in a warm
place and let it rise over night. In the morning the dough
will have increased to three times its original volume, and
will be a perfect sponge. Knead it in the bowl for five
minutes—do not use flour—and then shape into three
small loaves. Put these in deep pans, and with a sharp
knife cut lengthwise through the centre of each loaf. Put
the pans in a warm place and cover with clean towels. Let
the loaves rise to twice their size, and then bake in a moderately
hot oven for fifty minutes.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Sift the flour into the bread bowl. Take out half a cupful
to use in kneading. Put the salt, sugar, and half the
butter in the flour. Dissolve the yeast and mix with the
flour. Beat well with a strong spoon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sprinkle flour on the board and knead the dough for
twenty minutes or half an hour. Return to the bowl, and
rub the remainder of the butter or lard over it. Cover
with a clean towel; then put a tin or wooden cover on the
bowl and raise and finish as directed in the rule for bread
made with dry yeast. This will make two small loaves or
one large one.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Potato Bread.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>

      <div class='line'>1 potato.</div>
      <div class='line'>1/2 teaspoonful of salt.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 tablespoonful of sugar.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 tablespoonful of butter or lard.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Cover the potato with boiling water and cook for thirty
minutes. Take it up and mash fine and light; then pour the
boiling water on it. Let this stand until it is blood-warm;
then beat into it the yeast, sugar, and a pint and a half of
flour. Beat well for ten minutes; then cover the dough
and set it in a warm place to rise. It will take between
four and five hours. When the dough has risen to a light
sponge, add the salt and butter or lard to it, and beat well.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sprinkle the board with flour, turn the dough out on it
and knead for fifteen or twenty minutes. Return the dough
to the bowl; cover, and set in a warm place to rise. When
it has risen to more than double the original size, shape it
into two small loaves, or a loaf of medium size and a small
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>pan of rolls. Cover the bread with a clean towel and raise
to double the original size.</p>

<p class='c009'>If all the dough be put into one loaf, it must be baked
for one hour; if two small loaves be made, bake them for
forty-five minutes. This is delicious bread. Milk may be
substituted for water.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Entire-wheat Bread.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>

<p class='c009'>Sift the flour into the mixing bowl, but take out a gill to
use in kneading. Dissolve the yeast in the water. Mix the
salt, sugar, and butter with the flour, and stir in the yeast
and water. Beat well; then knead for twenty minutes or
half an hour. Cover, and set to rise. Finish the same as
water bread.</p>

<p class='c009'>This bread must be mixed as soft as possible and should
be baked thoroughly. Bake a loaf of medium size one
hour and a quarter.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Graham Bread.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Sift the meal and flour into the mixing bowl, turning in
the bran also. Dissolve the yeast in the water, and add
the salt and molasses to it. Turn this mixture out on the
flour, and beat the dough vigorously for twenty minutes or
longer. Cover the bowl and let the dough rise over night.
In the morning wet the hand in cold water and beat the
dough for five or ten minutes; then shape, and put in a
well buttered pan. Let it rise to nearly double the original
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>size, and bake for an hour and a half, having the oven quite
hot the first half-hour, and very moderate the last hour.</p>

<p class='c009'>Success in making this bread depends upon the thorough
beating and baking. Flours vary so much that it is impossible
to give the exact amount of liquid, but the dough
should be as thick as you can mix and beat it with the
hand. It must, however, never be kneaded stiff, like bread
made with white flour.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Rye Bread.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Substitute rye meal for graham, and proceed exactly as
directed for graham bread.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Rye Bread, No. 2.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Make this bread as directed for entire-wheat bread, substituting
fine rye flour for the entire-wheat flour.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sift all the meal into a bowl. Put the milk, molasses,
and salt into a bowl. Dissolve the soda in the cold water
and add to the liquid ingredients. Stir this into the meal
and beat vigorously for five minutes or more; then put
into a well buttered brown-bread tin and steam for five
hours; or the batter may be put into three one-pound
baking-powder cans. They will steam in less time than
if in the large loaf. Whatever sort of tin the loaf be
steamed in, it must have a cover. It will do no harm to
cook this bread more than five hours, but if in the large loaf
it must not cook less. Graham meal may be substituted
for the rye.</p>

Serve hot with cheese. Pulled bread is also nice with
chocolate or coffee.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Rolls from Bread Dough.</h3>

<p class='c011'>It is almost impossible to shape and raise rolls for an
early breakfast, but if one have a cold room or a refrigerator
the rolls can be put in the pan the night before, and they
will then be ready to bake for breakfast. Reserve about
a pint and a half of the risen bread dough and work into
it a tablespoonful of butter or lard. Put the dough in a
bowl; cover it with a plate and place the bowl in the
refrigerator or in a cold room. In the evening shape the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>dough into rolls and rub a little soft butter over them.
Cover the pan closely, but leave ample room for the rolls to
rise; then put in the refrigerator or cold room. Bake in

      <div class='line'>1 teaspoonful of sugar.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 tablespoonful of butter or lard.</div>
      <div class='line'>1/4 cake of compressed yeast, or 1/4 cupful of liquid yeast.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Boil the milk, and let it cool. Sift the flour into the
mixing bowl. Mix the salt and sugar with the flour. Make
a hole in the middle of the flour, by drawing it back to the
sides of the pan. Pour the milk very gently into this place,
being careful not to wet the flour above the point where
the milk will come when it is all poured in. Now add the
dissolved yeast, stirring gently at the bottom of the pan.
Cover the bowl and set in a warm place for four hours;
then stir the mixture until a dough is formed. Add the
butter or lard, and knead on the board for twenty minutes.
Do not use any flour in kneading. Put the dough back in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>the bowl; cover, and set in a warm place to rise to nearly
three times the original size (it will take about three hours
for this). Next put the dough on the board and roll down
to the thickness of half an inch. Cut the dough with an
oval cutter. Place a small round stick on the roll, about
one third of the distance from the end. Press with the
stick until the dough is half as thick here as in other parts.
Fold the short end of the dough over, and the roll will be
shaped. A little soft butter may be placed between the
folds. Place the rolls in a buttered pan, having them a
little way apart. Cover, and set in rather a cool place—say
seventy degrees—until the rolls are risen to a little
more than double the original size. Bake them in a moderately
hot oven for twenty minutes.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Caution.</i> Do not use any flour in kneading the dough,
and when it has risen put no flour on the board when it is to
be rolled out. The risen dough must not be kneaded, merely
turned on the board and rolled thin. If the rolls be required
for luncheon begin them at half past seven or eight
o’clock in the morning, and double the amount of yeast.
The raising time will then be only half that given. This
dough can be used for luncheon rolls and pin wheels.</p>

twenty minutes. Return the dough to the bowl, and cover
closely,—first with a towel, then with a tin or wooden cover.
Set in a warm place over night. In the morning shape in
either long or cleft rolls, and let these rise in the pans for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>an hour and a quarter, or until they have doubled in size.
Bake in a moderately hot oven for half an hour, if the rolls
be placed close together; but if they be detached, as would
be the case with cleft rolls, bake for only fifteen or twenty
minutes.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Luncheon Rolls.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Make the dough for milk rolls. In the morning work it
well in the bowl; then sprinkle the board lightly with flour,
and roll the dough down to the thickness of a quarter of an
inch. Spread this with soft butter and roll up as for a jelly
roll. Cut from this slices about an inch thick, and set
them on end in a buttered baking-pan. Have the rolls a
little way apart and let them rise to double the original
size. Bake them in a moderately hot oven for twenty-five
minutes.</p>

Now add the milk to the mixture, stirring quickly and vigorously
with a strong spoon. Sprinkle the board with flour
and turn out the dough upon it. Roll down to the thickness
of about half an inch and cut with a small cutter.
Bake in a quick oven. Do not crowd the biscuit in the pan.
If they be cut small, and the oven be very hot, they will
bake in ten or twelve minutes. They should not stand in
the oven after they are done.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>It is impossible to give in this receipt the exact quantity

<p class='c009'>Put the flour, salt, and sugar in a bowl. Add the water
and yeast, and beat vigorously for fifteen minutes. Cover
the bowl, and set in a warm place over night. In the morning
beat in the melted butter and pour the batter into buttered
muffin pans. Let the crumpets rise for an hour, and
bake them for half an hour in a moderate oven.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>If you choose you may add the butter to the mixture at
night. In that case the risen sponge may be taken out by
spoonfuls, being careful not to break it down, and the crumpets
will then require only half an hour to rise.</p>

<p class='c009'>Crumpets may be baked on a griddle instead of in muffin
pans. If they are baked on a griddle, measure the quart of
flour lightly. When ready to fry them, butter the muffin
rings and also a griddle, which should not be so hot as for
common griddle-cakes. Place the buttered rings on the
griddle and put a spoonful of the batter in each one. When
the crumpets get done on one side, turn them, and brown
the other side. It will take about twelve minutes to cook
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dissolve the soda in the cold water and work into the
dough. Now add the butter, sugar, nutmeg, wine, and the
eggs, well beaten. Mix all thoroughly, and then beat in
the flour. Stir in the raisins, and put into a deep well

</div>

<p class='c009'>Beat the butter to a cream. Gradually beat into it the
sugar, then the spice and lemon, and next the molasses.
Now dissolve the soda in one tablespoonful of cold water,
and stir it into the sour milk. Add this and the egg, well
beaten, to the other ingredients. Lastly, add the flour, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>beat briskly for half a minute. Pour into a well buttered
pan, and bake in a moderate oven for about fifty minutes.</p>

<p class='c009'>This cake will keep moist for a week or ten days. If
one like fruit, half a cupful of stoned raisins and half a
cupful of currants may be stirred lightly into the batter just
before it is put in the pan.</p>

      <div class='line'>2 eggs.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Beat the butter to a cream, then beat in the sugar.
When very light, beat in the jam and nutmeg. Dissolve
the soda in one tablespoonful of cold water, and add it to
the sour cream. Add this and the egg, well beaten, to the
other ingredients. Now add the flour, and beat for half a
minute. Sprinkle a tablespoonful of flour over the raisins,
and stir them in lightly. Pour the batter into a well buttered
pan, and bake for fifty minutes. This makes one
small loaf.</p>

<p class='c009'>This cake may be put away to be used as a pudding when
convenient. Steam it for one hour, and serve with a wine
sauce. It is almost as good as a plum pudding.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Rich Sponge Cake.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Grate a little of the lemon rind into a deep saucer.
Squeeze the juice on this. Beat the yolks of the eggs and
the sugar together until the mixture is a light, spongy mass.
Add the lemon juice and rind, and beat a little longer.
Beat the whites of the eggs with a whisk until a thick white
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>froth is formed. Cut the flour and whites of eggs into the
sugar and yolks, adding only a little at a time, and doing
the work lightly and gently, so as not to break down the
frothy egg. Pour the mixture into a well buttered pan, and
bake in a moderate oven, the time of baking depending
upon the thickness of the loaf. If it be three inches deep
when put in the pan, it will take one hour to bake. It is
essential that the oven should be very slow at first. This
will cause the sponge to rise evenly, making the cake tender,
rich, and moist.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Beat the eggs together until light. Add the sugar, and
beat with a spoon for ten minutes or longer. The sugar
and eggs must be beaten until they form a light, spongy
mass. Add the juice of the lemon, and beat a little longer.
Dissolve the soda in the cold water. Mix the cream of tartar
with the flour. Stir the water and soda into the egg
mixture; then add the flour. Beat well, and pour into the
pans and bake.</p>

<p class='c009'>These materials will make two sheets, or one sheet and
a small, round loaf, or one sheet and one cake, baked in a
deep round tin. The round cake can be used for a cream,
Washington, or chocolate pie. A part of the batter may be
baked in a pudding dish, and served with a liquid sauce;
or a part of the batter may be baked in tin muffin cups,
putting a teaspoonful in each cup.</p>

<p class='c009'>This sponge cake is one of the most useful and satisfactory
when made properly. Great care must be taken to
have the sugar and eggs beaten together thoroughly.</p>

the batter, and beat vigorously for a few seconds; then
turn into a well buttered shallow cake pan. Bake for thirty
minutes in a moderate oven.</p>

<p class='c009'>A good flavor for this cake is one tablespoonful of lemon
juice and a light grating of the rind of a fresh lemon.</p>

powdered sugar on the eggs, and beat for three minutes.
Add the vanilla. Gradually add the flour, and beat it in
quickly. Pour the batter into an ungreased pan, and put
into rather a cool oven. Bake for about forty minutes.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the cake is baked, take the pan from the oven and
invert it, letting it rest on a sieve or rack, so that there
shall be a current of air under and over the pan while the
cake is cooling.</p>

<p class='c009'>Success in making angel cake depends upon the proper
beating of the eggs and a slow oven.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here is a rule which gives doughnuts that will keep moist
and good for several days:—</p>

<p class='c009'>In the evening beat the butter to a cream and beat the
sugar and spice into it. Beat the eggs until light, and stir
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>into the mixture of butter and sugar. Dissolve the soda
in half a tablespoonful of cold water. Stir this mixture
into the sour milk and add all to the sugar, butter, and eggs.
Now stir in the flour. Cover the mixture and set it away
in a cold place until morning. In the morning sprinkle
the moulding board with flour and put about one fourth of
the dough on it. Roll this down to the thickness of half
an inch and cut into round cakes with a hole in the centre.
If you do not possess a regular doughnut cutter, a biscuit
cutter will do, as a piece can be cut from the centre with a
thimble. Fry in lard for about three minutes.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is supposed that pastry flour will be used. If, however,
the “new process” flour be taken, omit one eighth of
the measure.</p>

turning the doughnuts frequently. Lift them from the fat
with a wire spoon or a fork. Do not stick the fork into
them. When they are drained, sprinkle them with powdered
sugar. Be careful not to have the fat too hot and
to hold the teaspoonful of batter close to the fat, and the
doughnuts will come up in round balls. These are very

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1 pint of milk.</div>

      <div class='line'>1/6 of a nutmeg, grated.</div>
      <div class='line'>2 eggs.</div>
      <div class='line'>A piece of stick cinnamon about two inches long, or,</div>
      <div class='line'>1 teaspoonful of ground cinnamon.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>Put the milk and cinnamon on the fire in the double-boiler,
and cook for twenty minutes. Rub the squash
through a fine strainer, and add the salt, sugar, butter,
and nutmeg to it. Pour the boiling milk on this mixture.
Remove the cinnamon, and beat well; then set
away to cool. When cool, add the eggs, which should
have been thoroughly beaten with a spoon. Line a deep
plate with pastry and pour the squash mixture into it. Bake
for forty-five minutes in a moderate oven.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Sweet Potato Pie.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Make these the same as squash pies; using, however, a
scant measure of sugar.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Cream Pie.</h3>

      <div class='line'>Flavor.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Make this the same as cup cake and bake in a deep tin
plate, in a moderate oven, for about twenty minutes. When
the cake is cool, split it with a sharp knife, and fill with a
mixture made as follows:—</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Filling.</i></h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1/2 pint of milk.</div>
      <div class='line'>3 tablespoonfuls of sugar.</div>

      <div class='line'>Flavor.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Put the milk in the double-boiler and set on the fire.
Mix the flour and sugar together and add the unbeaten egg
to these ingredients. Beat with a spoon until light; then
stir into the boiling milk and cook for fifteen minutes, stirring
often. Now add the salt, and take from the fire.
When cool, add the flavor, which may be anything you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>choose. If orange, lemon, or vanilla extract, use half a
teaspoonful. Use the same flavor for the cake.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Washington Pie.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Make the cake the same as for cream pie, but bake it in
two deep tin plates for about twelve minutes. Spread one
sheet with any kind of jelly or marmalade. Lay the second
sheet on top of this and dredge with powdered sugar.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Chocolate Pie.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Make the same as cream pie, but add to the cream one
tablespoonful of chocolate dissolved with one tablespoonful
of sugar in half a tablespoonful of boiling water. Cover the
cake with a chocolate icing.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Berry Tart.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1-1/2 pints of berries.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 gill of sugar.</div>

      <div class='line'>3 tablespoonfuls of water.</div>
      <div class='line'>Half the rule for delicate paste.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Put the berries in an oval vegetable dish that has a broad
rim. Mix the sugar and flour together and sprinkle over
the berries. Pour the water over the mixture. Roll the
paste to the shape of the top of the dish, but a little larger.
Prick with a fork, and cover the top of the dish, turning in
the edges. Bake in a moderate oven for about fifty minutes.
When cold, sprinkle powdered sugar over the crust,
and serve.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sugar is for blackberries, blueberries, strawberries,
raspberries, and cherries. Currants and gooseberries will
require twice as much sweetening.</p>

<p class='c009'>The dish may be filled with apples or peaches, cut in
quarters, instead of the berries. In that case use twice as
much water, and flavor with a little nutmeg.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>These tarts are much more healthful than pies, the undercrust
of which is apt to be soggy.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Apple Turnovers.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Mix the flour, salt, baking powder, and sugar. Rub this
mixture through a sieve and then rub into it the butter.
Now beat the egg till light, and add to it the milk. Stir
this liquid into the dry ingredients. Sprinkle the moulding
board with flour, and roll down the dough to the thickness
of about one fourth of an inch. Cut this dough into cakes
the size of a saucer. It is a good way to lay a saucer upside
down on the dough and cut around it with a jagging-iron or
knife.</p>

<p class='c009'>Put two tablespoonfuls of stewed, sweetened, and seasoned
apples on each piece of dough; fold over, and roll up, pinching
the edges together. Have on the fire a kettle containing
hot fat about five or six inches deep. When the fat begins
to smoke, put in a few turnovers and cook for eight minutes.
Drain on brown paper. They are good hot or cold.</p>

<p class='c009'>The apple used in turnovers may be flavored with either
cinnamon or nutmeg.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pare and core the apples and cut them into eighths. Mix
the flour, salt, baking powder, and half a tablespoonful of
sugar together, and rub through a sieve. Warm a little of
the milk, and dissolve the butter in it. Add the remainder

smooth ball, and, putting it on a board that has been well
sprinkled with flour, roll very thin. Line a buttered melon
mould with it, having the sheet of dough large enough to
hang over the sides of the mould. Now fill the mould with
the apples and sprinkle the sugar over them. Bring the
edges of the paste together and put the cover on the mould.
Steam for two hours and a half. At serving time turn out
on a flat dish, and serve with wine or nutmeg sauce.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>This makes rather a large pudding for three people, if
the first part of the dinner has been substantial. If one

<h3 class='c010'>Quick Steamed Apple Pudding.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>

<p class='c009'>Put the apples, water, sugar, and nutmeg into a broad
porcelain or granite-ware saucepan, and set on the fire.
When the apples begin to boil, set back where they will
cook gently. Now mix the flour, salt, and baking powder
together and rub through a sieve. Rub the butter into this
dry mixture and then wet with the milk, stirring rapidly into
a soft dough. Sprinkle the bread board with flour, and
roll the dough into a round piece about the size of the top
of the saucepan. Lay this on the apples; then put on the
cover, and continue the gentle cooking for thirty minutes.
Now lift the crust to a plate for a moment, and turn the
apple into a pudding dish. Place the crust over it, and
serve with nutmeg sauce or creamy sauce.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Wash the tapioca and let it soak over night in the water.
In the morning put the tapioca and water in the double-boiler
and cook for one hour. Now stir into the cooked
tapioca the salt, sugar, lemon, and apples. Pour the mixture
into a pudding dish, and bake in a moderate oven for
an hour and a quarter. Let it stand in a warm place for
an hour before it is served. Powdered sugar and cream

  <h3 class='c010'>Peach Tapioca Pudding.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Make this the same as apple tapioca, but use fresh, canned,

</div>

<p class='c009'>Have the apples pared and sliced. Beat the egg until
light; then add the sugar, and beat five minutes longer.
Now add the milk, and finally the flour, with which should
be mixed the baking powder. Beat the batter, and pour
it into a well buttered pudding dish that will hold about a
quart. Cover with the apples, and bake in a moderately
hot oven for about forty minutes. Serve with a hot liquid

<h3 class='c010'>Prune Pudding.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>

      <div class='line'>Liquid cochineal.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Soak the gelatine in half a pint of cold water. Wash the
prunes thoroughly, and put them in a stewpan with a pint
and a half of water. Cook them slowly for two hours. Take
the prunes from the liquid, and remove the stones. Measure
the liquid, and if there be more than half a pint, boil it rapidly
until reduced to that amount. If, however, there be less
than half a pint, add enough water to make the full measure.
Return the liquid and prunes to the fire. Color with a few
drops of cochineal. Add the lemon juice, soaked gelatine,
and sugar. Stir the mixture until the gelatine is dissolved;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>then turn it into a mould, and set away to harden. Serve
this pudding with either whipped cream or soft custard.</p>

<p class='c009'>If the flavor of wine be liked, the water in which the
prunes were cooked may be reduced to a gill, and a gill of
wine be added to the mixture.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Prune Tapioca Pudding.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>1/2 cupful of sugar.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Wash the tapioca and soak it over night in the three cupfuls
of cold water. In the morning put the tapioca and
water in the double-boiler and cook for one hour. Before
putting the tapioca on to cook, wash the prunes, and, putting
them in a saucepan with cold water enough to cover
them, place on the fire. Let them simmer gently until they
absorb all the water; then turn out on a plate to cool, and
remove the stones.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the tapioca has been cooking for an hour, stir all
the seasonings into it. Spread a layer of the tapioca in a
small pudding dish; then sprinkle with prunes, next with
another layer of tapioca, and finally with the remainder of
the prunes. Cover with the tapioca and bake in a moderate
oven for one hour. Take the pudding from the oven and
let it partially cool; then serve with sugar and cream, or
with soft custard.</p>

<p class='c009'>After measuring the tapioca, turn it out on the moulding
board and crush it as fine as possible with the rolling pin.
Now wash it, and soak it in the cold water for three hours
or longer,—better over night, if there be time. Put the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>soaked tapioca in a double-boiler and cook it until it is
perfectly clear. If it has been soaked over night it will
cook in half an hour, but if soaked for only three hours it
will require cooking for an hour and a half. When the
tapioca is clear, add the sugar, salt, and lemon; then take
the dish from the fire and stir in the raspberries. Rinse a
bowl with cold water and pour the pudding into it. Set
away to cool. At serving time turn out the pudding on a
flat dish and surround it with whipped cream; or it may
be served with plain cream.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Custard Pudding.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1-1/2 pints of milk.</div>
      <div class='line'>3 eggs.</div>
      <div class='line'>1/2 teaspoonful of salt.</div>
      <div class='line'>3 tablespoonfuls of sugar.</div>
      <div class='line'>1/6 of a nutmeg, grated.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Break the eggs into a bowl and add the sugar and salt.
Beat well with a spoon,—never with an egg beater, as
they must not be light. Add the milk to them and turn
into a small pudding dish. Place the dish in a pan of
warm water and set in a very moderate oven. Bake the
pudding until firm in the centre. It should take not less
than half an hour; better longer, as the slower the custard
cooks the smoother and richer it will be. The oven must
not be hot enough to have the water boil. Test the custard
by running a knife down the centre. If it comes out
clean the custard is done; but if a milky substance clings to
it, cook the pudding a little longer. The flavor may be cinnamon,
lemon, or anything else one chooses.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>Soak the cake in the milk for one hour. Beat the whites
of the eggs to a stiff froth, and beat into them the sugar
and yolks of eggs. Stir this mixture into the cake and
milk. Add the salt, lemon rind, and cocoanut. Turn the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>mixture into a buttered pudding dish, and bake slowly for
about thirty-five minutes. Serve cold.</p>

<p class='c009'>Put the water and raisins in a stewpan; cover, and simmer
for half an hour. At the end of that time stir in the
salt and oatmeal. Boil rapidly for one minute; then set
the stewpan back where the contents will only simmer for

they will keep warm until serving time; then turn them out
on a flat dish and put a bit of bright jelly on top of each

vanilla or lemon extract. If cinnamon be liked, a piece
about four inches long may be cooked with the rice and
milk, and be removed when the sugar and salt are added.
Stir the mixture well, and turn into a pudding dish. Bake
in a moderate oven for half an hour, and put away to cool.

<h3 class='c010'>Soft Custard.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1 pint of milk.</div>
      <div class='line'>2 large tablespoonfuls of sugar.</div>
      <div class='line'>3 eggs.</div>
      <div class='line'>1/8 teaspoonful of salt.</div>
      <div class='line'>Flavor.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Beat the eggs and sugar together for six minutes, and
add a gill of cold milk to them. Put the remainder of the
milk in the double-boiler and set on the fire. When this
milk comes to the boiling point, pour it over the ingredients
in the bowl, and stir well. Turn the mixture into
the double-boiler, and, placing it on the fire, cook, stirring
all the while, until the custard will coat the spoon. It will
take about five minutes. Take from the fire, and instantly
turn into the cold bowl. Stir constantly until it begins to
cool. Should it grow thin as it cools, you may know that
it has not cooked enough; in which case it should be returned
to the double-boiler and cooked a little longer. If,
on the other hand, it begins to look slightly curdled on taking
it from the fire, it has cooked too much. In that case,
pour it back and forth from one bowl to another, holding
the bowl from which it is poured quite high, and the custard
will become smooth again, unless it be very much overdone.</p>

<p class='c009'>Soft custard is one of the easiest dishes for dessert that
one can make, and one of the most useful; but only experience
will enable one to detect the changes in the cooking
mixture. It is impossible to give exact time. When eggs
are cheap allow four; for this dish is improved by the use
of a generous number.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>The yolks of the eggs make a richer custard than when
the whole egg is used. If the whites be required for any
other purpose, you may use even half a dozen yolks.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Baked Cup Custards.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Make these the same as the custard pudding, and pour
into four custard cups. Place the cups in a pan of warm
water and bake in a moderate oven until firm in the centre.</p>

the eggs and sugar, and, as soon as the milk boils, stir in
this mixture. Cook for five minutes, stirring all the time.
Take from the fire and add the vanilla extract. Pour into a

<h3 class='c012'>DIRECTIONS FOR FREEZING.</h3>

<div  class='figright id028'>
<img src='images/p295.png' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>MALLET AND ICE-BAG.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The mixture to be frozen should be icy cold. Put it in
the freezing can, and place this in position in the wooden
tub. See that every part of
the freezer is properly fastened,
and that the can and
beater work with ease when
the crank is turned. Pound
the ice in a bag until it is
almost as fine as snow. Put
a layer of ice in the freezer,
having it come about one
third the height of the tin
can. Now add a layer of salt,
and, with a wooden paddle or a flat stick, pack the salt and
ice as solid as possible. Continue this until the salt and
ice come to the top of the tin can. Work the freezer
occasionally, that the mixture may be more firmly packed.
Now begin to turn the crank slowly for ten minutes; then
turn rapidly for ten minutes longer, at the end of which
time the mixture should be frozen into a light, thick mass.
Take off the cross-piece; next wipe the top of the tin can;
take out the beater, scrape off all the frozen mixture, and
return it to the freezer. Work a strong iron spoon up and
down in the cream until the mass becomes compact and
light. Place a piece of white or brown paper over the
can, and then put on the cover and replace the cross-piece.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>Put a piece of woollen carpet over the tub and set
away in a cold place.</p>

<p class='c009'>In warm weather it will be necessary to repack the cream.
To do this, place the freezer on the edge of the sink and
take the stopper from the lower part of the tub. This will
allow the water to pass off. Now put back the stopper and
pack with enough salt and ice to come over the cover of the
tin can.</p>

<p class='c009'>For a two-quart freezer allow for the first packing one
pint and a half of salt and enough ice to pack <i>hard</i> to the
top of the wooden tub. Snow may be used in winter. If
the snow should be very dry, sprinkle a little water over
each layer before it is packed down. Never let the water
off while freezing, unless there be danger of its coming up
to the cover of the tin can. In that case take out the stopper
and let off only enough water to be assured that the
rest cannot get into the tin can. The water is essential to
the freezing of the cream.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the frozen mixture has been used, and the ice has
melted, pour the water into a strainer, and save the salt to
use when freezing again.</p>

<p class='c009'>Any other flavor may be substituted for vanilla. For

</div>

<h3 class='c010'>Tea.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c011'>THE making of a good cup of tea is one of the simplest
things in the world. Use an earthenware or china
teapot. Fill it with boiling water and let stand for four or five
minutes; then pour out the water, leaving not a drop in the
pot. Put the dry tea into the warm pot and after putting
on the cover, set back where it will keep warm for a few
minutes; then pour the boiling water on the tea and send
to the table. This is for all the light kinds of tea, such as
Oolong or black tea. English breakfast tea should steep
on the fire for a few minutes, to suit most tastes. If made
without this steeping, it has a much brighter and fresher
flavor, but it lacks the body so much prized by lovers of
this beverage.</p>

<p class='c009'>The proportions of tea and water vary with the taste of
the family or individual. The old rule of a teaspoonful for
each person and a teaspoonful for the pot, makes rather
strong tea, if three gills of water be allowed for each
person.</p>

<p class='c009'>The water must be boiling when it is poured on the dry
tea. Many people seem to think that, if it has boiled some
time in the past, it will suffice simply to have it hot when
the tea is made. But if water boil a long time all the gases
will be driven off, and the water become flat and flavorless.
Such water is unfit for the making of tea and coffee.</p>

<p class='c009'>Keep the teakettle clean, by washing it out every day,
and always fill the kettle with fresh water when preparing to
make tea or coffee.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>The Oolong and all light teas deteriorate with age,
whereas English breakfast tea improves.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Coffee.</h3>

<div  class='figright id029'>
<img src='images/p301.png' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>COFFEE-MILL.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Much of the quality of a cup of coffee depends upon the
berry, and the process of making. There are two classes of
berries: the strong and the mild. To the strong belong
the Rio and Santas; to the mild, the Java, Mocha, Maracaibo,
and others. The last named kinds are usually the
highest priced.</p>

<p class='c009'>Coffee should not be roasted a long time before it is
ground. Few housekeepers roast their own coffee. Only
a small amount of the roasted article should be bought at a
time. It should be kept in an air-tight jar and in a dry
place. Do not buy the coffee already ground, for it loses
its fine flavor more rapidly when in
the ground form than when whole.
Have a small mill, that can be regulated
to grind coarse or fine.</p>

<p class='c009'>A mixture of two or more kinds of
coffee gives the most satisfactory results.
Two thirds Java or Maracaibo
with one third Mocha will give a rich,
smooth coffee. If the flavor be desired
strong, one part Java, one part Mocha, and one
part Rio may be used. If economy must be practised,
all Rio may be taken. If the roasted coffee be thoroughly
heated just before or after it has been ground, and if, after
being taken from the fire, but while still hot, a little butter
be stirred into it, the beverage will be much richer and
smoother; or the entire purchase may be thoroughly heated
at one time, and the butter be stirred into it then. Allow a
generous tablespoonful of butter to a pound of coffee.</p>

<p class='c009'>There are many methods of making coffee. Two of the
best are given below.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>Boiled Coffee.</h3>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>2 tablespoonfuls of coarsely ground coffee.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 pint of boiling water.</div>
      <div class='line'>2 tablespoonfuls of cold water.</div>
      <div class='line'>1/8 saltspoonful of salt.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Scald the coffee-pot with boiling water. Put the dry coffee
into it and pour the boiling water upon it. Place on the
fire, and, when it begins to boil, draw the pot back where
the coffee will just bubble for five minutes. At the end of
that time add the salt and cold water. Set the pot back
where the coffee cannot boil, and let it stand for two or
three minutes; then serve.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is a coffee settler in the market which can be used
instead of the salt and water.</p>

<p class='c009'>An egg makes the coffee richer in flavor, and clears it
perfectly. One small egg will answer for six or eight tablespoonfuls
of coffee. The egg, shell and all, should be
broken into a cup and beaten. After using what is required,
cover the cup and put it in a cold place. This will keep
for two or three days.</p>

<p class='c009'>When an egg is used for clearing the coffee it should be
stirred into the dry grounds, and be cooked with the coffee.</p>

<p class='c009'>If one wish the beverage stronger or weaker, increase or
diminish the amount of the ground berry.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Filtered Coffee.</h3>

<div  class='figright id030'>
<img src='images/p303.png' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>COFFEE BIGGIN.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Coffee biggins come expressly for making filtered, or
“drip” coffee. There are two compartments to this pot.
In the upper one there is a double strainer, on which is
placed the coffee. Above the coffee there is placed
another rather coarse strainer. This upper compartment
is placed on the lower one; boiling water is poured
through the upper strainer and it falls like rain upon the
coffee below. The points to remember when making
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>coffee in this way are to have the pot hot, the coffee
ground to a fine powder, the water poured on gradually
while boiling, and not to have the
beverage boil.</p>

<p class='c009'>Use two tablespoonfuls of finely ground
coffee to one pint of boiling water. After
putting the coffee in the pot, and fitting
every part into its proper place, set the
coffee-pot in a pan of hot water and on
the range. Pour half a gill of boiling
water into the upper strainer, and put
on the cover. Let this stand for three
or four minutes, that the powder may become wet and
swell. Now add half the remaining boiling water; and
after two or three minutes add the remainder. At the
end of five minutes all the water will have filtered
through, and the coffee be ready to serve.</p>

<p class='c009'>A small quantity of coffee cannot be made in a large pot,
because the water will pass through the thin layer of powder
before it has had time to extract the strength of the berry.
If all the water were poured on the powder at once, it
would dislodge the dry grains and pass through without
extracting the flavor from the coffee.</p>

<p class='c009'>A flannel bag is often hung in a coffee-pot, the fine
powder being put in it and the boiling water poured
directly on the dry coffee. There are many inventions
in the line of coffee-pots which are very satisfactory,
but the housekeeper should investigate and test them for
herself.</p>

<p class='c009'>Coffee-pots must be kept absolutely clean, if you would
have a satisfactory cup of coffee. A few old grounds,
lodged in a groove in the pot, may spoil the flavor of the
finest berry.</p>

<p class='c009'>If you cannot have cream for your cup of coffee, at least
have hot milk.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>Cocoa.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Several preparations are made from the cocoa bean.
We find the product in the market in the form of chocolate,
plain, and also sweetened and flavored. This is the
roasted bean ground to a smooth, fine substance, which
retains the oily substance known as cocoa butter. This
makes a rich beverage which few people can use daily.
The chocolate is valuable in the preparation of various
kinds of food and confections, and to use occasionally as
a beverage. In its sweetened form it can be taken in the
pocket when going on long tramps; an ounce of it will
allay the feeling of faintness and hunger which comes with
long fasting.</p>

<p class='c009'>Breakfast cocoa is made by pressing nearly all the cocoa
butter from the roasted and finely ground bean. This gives
a delicate dry powder, which makes a digestible, nutritious,
and pleasant drink. Because it in part takes the place of
animal food, it is very economical.</p>

<p class='c009'>The cocoa shells and nibs, when prepared as a beverage,
are not very valuable as a food, because only a small part of
the cocoa is extracted in the boiling. The process of preparing
the cocoa bean for the market is almost wholly
mechanical, so that when you get your cocoa and chocolate
from a trustworthy manufacturer you may be sure that you
are using a perfectly pure article and one absolutely clean.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Chocolate.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1 pint of milk.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 ounce of good chocolate.</div>
      <div class='line'>1-1/2 tablespoonfuls of sugar.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 tablespoonful of hot water.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Put the milk on the fire, in the double-boiler. Shave the
chocolate, and, putting it into a small pan with the sugar
and water, stir over a hot fire until smooth and glossy.
Stir this into the boiling milk; then beat the chocolate with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>a whisk, to make it froth. Pour into a hot pot, and serve
at once.</p>

<p class='c009'>Long cooking separates the oil from the chocolate and
spoils the beverage.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Breakfast Cocoa.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1 pint of milk.</div>
      <div class='line'>2 level teaspoonfuls of breakfast cocoa.</div>
      <div class='line'>3 tablespoonfuls of water.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Put the milk in the double-boiler and set on the fire.
Mix the cocoa to a smooth paste, with the cold water.
When the milk boils, add the cocoa, and boil for one
minute. Serve hot.</p>

<p class='c009'>The flavor of this cocoa is always finer when the milk
actually bubbles up after the cocoa is added. If water or
part water be used, measure the cocoa more generously.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nothing is much more delicious than a good cup of
cocoa, and nothing is more disappointing than the slops
one so often gets under this name, because many people
prepare it by pouring hot water on the powder and then
adding sugar and milk. This will do when it is impossible
to boil it, but it is only a makeshift. It should be
remembered that the cocoa bean contains a considerable
amount of starch, and this starch will be improved by
boiling.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Broma.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Broma is prepared the same as cocoa, but requires a few
minutes’ longer cooking, because of the addition of a starchy
substance to the powder.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Cocoa Shells and Nibs.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The thin shells that are removed from the roasted cocoa
bean, and a part of the nut in a roughly broken state, are
used for a beverage. The shells are sometimes used alone,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>but this makes rather a poor drink. The shells and nibs
are put into a cocoa pot with boiling water and simmered
for four hours or more. Use a gill of the shells, one tablespoonful
of the nibs, and a quart of water. This will give a
generous pint of the beverage. Serve it with hot milk and
sugar.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Lemonade.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1 lemon.</div>
      <div class='line'>1/2 pint of water.</div>
      <div class='line'>2 tablespoonfuls of sugar.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Squeeze the lemon and strain the juice. Add the sugar
and water to it and use at once. It should be very cold or
very hot. Add ice in warm weather.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the water is not good, or in case of sickness, boiling
water may be poured on the sugar and fruit juice; then
cool the lemonade.</p>

<p class='c009'>When making a lemonade for a company of people, it
may be mixed in a large handsome bowl. Add to it all or
any one of the following named fruits:—</p>

<p class='c009'>For one gallon of lemonade use four quarts of water,
twenty lemons, one quart of sugar, one banana, half a pineapple,
six oranges, one pint of strawberries.</p>

<p class='c009'>Use the juice of the lemons and oranges; have the pineapple
and banana cut in thin slices; the strawberries should
be whole. Raspberries, as well as strawberries, may be
used.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXI.<br /> <br />PRESERVES AND PICKLES.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c010'>Quality of the Fruit.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c011'>IT is a waste of time and strength to preserve unripe, over-ripe
or inferior fruits. One should select sound, ripe,
well flavored fruits for this purpose.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>What to do with Fruit Pulp.</h3>

<p class='c011'>When making jellies with crab apples, quinces, peaches,
etc., there is always a great deal of pulp left. The thrifty
housekeeper does not like to throw this away, although
all the fine flavor of the fruit has been extracted with the
juice. If fruit be plentiful and cheap, it will be economy to
throw this impoverished pulp away; if, on the other hand,
fruit be high and scarce, add some fresh fruit, sugar, and
water to the cooked pulp, and boil until a smooth marmalade
is formed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cooked quince may be combined with fresh tart apples,
sugar, and a little water. While the mixture is hot, can it,
and it will be found good for pies and other uses when the
fresh fruit is scarce.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Preserved Peaches.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The peaches should be sound and ripe. Weigh the fruit,
and for every nine pounds make a syrup with three pounds
of sugar and one pint of water; skimming the syrup as soon
as it boils up.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>Have ready a kettle of boiling water and a bowl of cold
water. Fill a wire basket with peaches and plunge into the
boiling water for two minutes. Lift the basket from the
water and turn the peaches into a bowl. Pare them, and
drop them into the cold water. This is to preserve the
color.</p>

<p class='c009'>Drop the peaches, a few at a time, into the boiling syrup.
Cook them until they are heated through, and are tender;
then put in a hot jar as many as will go in without crowding,
and fill up with syrup. Cover the jar at once.</p>

<p class='c009'>If many peaches are to be preserved it is best to make
the syrup in several lots, as otherwise the long cooking,
together with the fruit juice, will make it dark.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Preserved Pears.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Make a syrup like that for the peaches, allowing one
quart of water to three pounds of sugar and nine pounds of
pears.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pare the pears with a silver knife and drop them in a
bowl of cold water to preserve the color. On taking them
from the water drop them into the boiling syrup. Cook
them gently until they can be easily pierced with a silver
fork. The time depends upon the ripeness of the fruit.
The pears may be preserved whole or in halves. Put the
cooked fruit into hot jars, and, after filling up with boiling
syrup, seal.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Crab Apples.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Make the syrup as for peaches; allowing, however, half a
pound of sugar to a pound of fruit. Clean the blossom end
of the apples by rubbing, and drop them into water. Wash
and drain them. Drop them, a few at a time, into the hot
syrup, and cook until they can be pierced with a silver
fork. Fill the jars with the fruit, and, after filling up with
hot syrup, seal the jars.</p>

<p class='c009'>The stems are left on crab apples.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>Preserved Plums.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Make the syrup for the large white plums the same as for
crab apples. Peel the plums by plunging in boiling water,
like peaches. Cook and finish the same as crab apples.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Preserved Damson Plums.</h3>

<p class='c011'>These are preserved the same as the white plums, except
that they are not peeled. They will cook in about three
minutes.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Grape Preserve.</h3>

<p class='c011'>This preserve should be made with a tender-skinned
grape. The Concord grape is too tough-skinned to make
a satisfactory preserve.</p>

<p class='c009'>Squeeze the pulp out of the skin, and, after putting it in
the preserving kettle, set on the fire. Stir frequently, and
cook until the pulp will break up readily. This will require
only a few minutes’ boiling. Rub the pulp through a sieve,
rejecting the seeds. Measure the skins and pulp, and put
them in the preserving kettle. For every quart of the fruit
add one pint and a half of sugar, and one gill of water.
Cook for twenty minutes after the preserve begins to boil;
then put in jars and seal. If you choose, use less sugar;
or, if you prefer to have the preserve sweeter, allow a pound
of sugar for each pound of fruit.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Preserved Quinces.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Have a kettle of boiling water on the fire. Pare the fruit
and remove the cores; then weigh it. Drop the pared
fruit into the boiling water, and cook gently until so tender
that it can be pierced with a straw. Take it from the water
and drain it. Make a syrup the same as for peaches, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>put the cooked fruit into it. Simmer for about half an
hour; then put up in jars. This amount of sugar—one
pound to three pounds of fruit—makes a fairly rich preserve.
Less may be used if one prefer to have the quinces
less rich.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Preserved Pineapple.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Pare the pineapple, remove the eyes, and cut the fruit
into thin slices, cutting down the sides until the heart is
reached. Weigh the sliced fruit and put it in a bowl, with
half a pound of granulated sugar to every pound of fruit.
Mix the fruit and sugar well, and put it in a cold place over
night. In the morning put the fruit and sugar in the preserving
kettle, and place on the range. When the syrup
begins to boil, skim carefully; then fill the hot jars with the
preserve and seal them.</p>

<p class='c009'>The pineapple may be shredded with a silver fork, instead
of being sliced. Be careful to keep out all the woody
fibres of the heart of the fruit.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Preserved Uncooked Pineapple.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Pare the pineapple and take out all the eyes. With a
sharp knife, cut the fruit in thin slices, cutting down the
sides until the heart is reached (this is to be discarded).
Weigh the sliced pineapple and put it in an earthen dish.
Add to it as many pounds of granulated sugar as there are
pounds of fruit. Stir this gently; then pack the fruit and
sugar in pint jars, leaving space for two tablespoonfuls of
Jamaica rum in each jar. Add the liquor; then put on the
covers and tighten them. Set away in a cool, dark place.</p>

<p class='c009'>Wine or brandy may be substituted for the rum; or, the
jars may be packed solidly to the top, and sealed, without
using any spirit. This fruit will keep well, and is so tender
that it will melt in the mouth. It is, of course, very rich.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>Sun Cooked Strawberries.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Pick over the berries and weigh them; then put them in
the preserving kettle. Add to them as many pounds of granulated
sugar as there are of strawberries. Do not have the
fruit and sugar more than three or four inches deep in the
preserving kettle. Place on the fire and heat slowly to
the boiling point. Let the preserve cook for just ten minutes
from the time it begins to boil, skimming well. Take
up and pour into meat platters, having the preserve not much
more than an inch and a half deep. Set the platters on
tables at sunny windows. They should stand in the sun for
twenty-four full hours. If the sun does not shine one day,
let the fruit remain until it does. Put up cold in preserve
jars. This preserve is perfect.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>CANNING FRUITS.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The destruction of germs and the exclusion of air are the
principles upon which canning is based. The article to be
preserved is cooked for a short time, and then put in jars
from which the air has been expelled by heating them to
the boiling point. They are then sealed, and when cold
are set in a cool, dark place. If all the conditions be right,
the fruit will keep for an unlimited number of years, and
when opened will be found to have nearly all the freshness
and aroma of newly gathered fruit.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now this is true of the majority of fruits, but not of all.
The strawberry subjected to this process will come out a
pale, spongy, insipid thing, whereas the raspberry seems to
have its color, flavor, and odor intensified. If, however,
a generous amount of sugar be added to the strawberry in
the cooking, the fruit will retain its shape, color, and flavor.
It is an error to attempt to can this berry without sugar, or
with only a small amount.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>Filling the Jars.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>To fill the jars, have on the stove two pans partially filled
with water. Let the water in one be boiling, but in the other
not so hot that the hand cannot be held in it with comfort.
Put a few jars and covers in the cooler water, turning them
now and then until all parts become warm; then put them
in the boiling water. This does away with all danger of
breaking. When the jars have been heated in boiling water,
drain, fill, and seal them one at a time.</p>

<p class='c009'>In filling the jars be sure that they stand level, that the
syrup has filled all the interstices between the fruit, and that
it also runs over the top of the jars. Even with this overflowing
of the syrup it will be found that, after cooling,
the can is not quite full; but if the work has been properly
done, the fruit will keep all right.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Different Fruits Need Different Treatment.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Now, as to the different modes of treating various kinds
of fruit. We know that, when the germs are killed and the
air is excluded, sugar is not necessary for the preservation of
the fruit. But there are few kinds of fruit that are not improved
by some sugar, because it fixes the color and flavor,
and gives much finer results. Some kinds of fruit require
but little sugar for this purpose, while others are poor indeed
without a generous amount. One has only to contrast the
flavor and quality of the canned peaches that are put up
with and without sugar to realize the great superiority of
those with which saccharine matter has been used. Where
fruits are too dry to give out enough juice to cover them
generously, a light syrup should be used. But with juicy
fruits, avoid water if possible. A good rule in the case of
small berries is to allow one third of a pound of sugar to
each pound of fruit.</p>

<p class='c009'>For fruit like peaches, pears, plums, etc., make a light
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>syrup. Quinces must first be cooked in clear water until
tender.</p>

<p class='c009'>In paring fruit use silver-plated knives, and drop each
piece as soon as pared into a bowl of cold water, which has
been made acid by the addition of lemon juice. This prevents
the fruit from turning dark. Use earthen bowls, and
wooden or silver-plated spoons. Avoid any delay while
doing this work.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>To Can Small Fruits.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Any fruit, if boiled long enough to have all the germs
killed and the air expelled, will keep indefinitely if sealed
while boiling hot. Sugar helps to preserve the fruit, but it
is not absolutely essential to its preservation. Sugar, however,
preserves the fine flavor and color of the fruit. Some
fruits are not good when canned, unless a great deal of
sugar be used, whereas just the contrary is true of other
kinds. Tastes differ as to the amount of sugar to be employed;
each housekeeper must study her own tastes and
those of her family. Blueberries need no sugar, but are
richer if a little be used. Blackberries and raspberries are
better for some sugar,—say a pound of sugar to four or six
pounds of fruit. More may be used, if liked. Strawberries
require a great deal to preserve the color and texture. All
small fruits are richer if preserved in their own juice.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here is a rule for preserving raspberries, and the same general
principles apply to other fruits:—Take twelve quarts
of raspberries and two of sugar. Heat and crush three
quarts of the fruit; then turn it, together with the juice, into
a piece of cheese-cloth which has been placed over a bowl.
Squeeze as much juice as possible from the hot fruit. Put
the juice and sugar in the preserving kettle, and set on
the fire. When the mixture begins to boil, skim well, and
add the whole berries. Simmer for fifteen minutes, skimming
well. Put the hot fruit in heated jars, and seal.</p>

<p class='c009'>If the combined flavor of raspberry and currant be liked,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>use a quart of currant juice for the syrup. In that case use
an extra pint of sugar. The twelve quarts of raspberries are
then preserved whole.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Canned Rhubarb.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Get tender rhubarb. Pare it, and cut in pieces about
two inches long. Wash, and then pack it in glass jars.
Fill the jars with cold water, and let them stand for ten or
fifteen minutes. Pour off the water and fill the jars to overflowing
with fresh cold water. Seal the jars and put them in
a cool, dark place. This will keep for a year or more, and
should be treated the same as fresh uncooked rhubarb when
required for use.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Blackberry Jam.</h3>

<p class='c011'>After picking over the berries, put them in the preserving
kettle and set on the range. Stir the fruit frequently. Let
it boil for twenty minutes, counting from the time it begins
to bubble. Take it from the fire and rub it through a sieve
fine enough to keep back the seeds. Measure the strained
mixture and put it back in the preserving kettle with a pint
and a half of granulated sugar for every quart of strained fruit.
Heat the preserve slowly and stir frequently. Let it simmer
for forty-five minutes; then put up the jelly in tumblers.</p>

<p class='c009'>If the fruit be of the large, soft kind that has few seeds,
it need not be strained.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Raspberry Jam.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>12 quarts of raspberries.</div>
      <div class='line'>3 quarts of sugar.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Pick the fruit free from leaves, stems, and imperfect berries.
Put it in a preserving kettle and set on the fire. Stir
frequently. Simmer for half an hour after it begins to boil;
then add the sugar, and simmer for one hour longer. Put
the jam in hot jars, and seal while hot.</p>

  <h3 class='c010'>Currant and Raisin Jam.</h3>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>3 pounds of sugar.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 pound of raisins.</div>
      <div class='line'>3-1/2 pounds of currants.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 orange.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 pint of water.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Cut the raisins in two and seed them; then cook them
for one hour or more in the pint of water. Pick over the
currants and put them on to cook in the preserving kettle.
Add the orange juice, and cook for fifteen minutes after
the fruit begins to boil.</p>

<p class='c009'>Remove the seeds from the orange, and, after chopping
the pulp and peel very fine, rub through the sugar. When
the currants have been boiling for fifteen minutes, add the
other ingredients to them, and cook for fifteen minutes
longer. Put into jelly glasses, and when cold cover. This
quantity will fill twelve glasses.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Pear Marmalade.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>8 pounds of sugar.</div>

      <div class='line'>4 small lemons.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Boil the lemons in clear water until the peel can be
pierced with a broom splint; then cut it into small pieces.
Peel and chip the pears, and cut the ginger in thin slices.
Put all the ingredients into the preserving kettle and simmer
for two hours. Pour the marmalade into jelly glasses.
This quantity will fill eighteen.</p>

<p class='c009'>The water in which the lemons are cooked is to be thrown
away.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Jellies.</h3>

<p class='c011'>In no department of preserving does the housekeeper
feel less sure of the results than in jelly making, so much
depends upon the condition of the fruit. This is more
pronounced in the case of small fruits than with the larger
kinds.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>When currants are over-ripe, or have been picked after a
rain, the result of using them will be uncertain. Perhaps
we notice it more with this fruit than with any other, because
it is so generally used for jelly. An understanding of the
properties of fruit which forms the basis of jellies may help
the housekeepers to a better knowledge of the conditions
and methods essential to success.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pectin, which forms the basis of vegetable jellies, is a substance
which, in its composition, resembles starch and gum.
It gives to the juices of fruits the property of gelatinizing.
This property is at its best when the fruit is just ripe; better
a little under-ripe than over-ripe. When boiled for a long
time fruit loses its gelatinous property and becomes of a
gummy nature.</p>

<p class='c009'>These facts show the importance of using fruit that is but
just ripe and freshly picked, as well as the need of care not
to overcook the juice.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Covering Jellies.</h3>

<p class='c011'>There are several methods of covering jellies. Pasting
paper over the top of the glass is one of the oldest. Thin
sheets of cotton batting, tied over the top, make a good
covering. A piece of white tissue paper cut to fit into the
glass, and simply laid on top of the jelly, is all that some
people use. It is stated that the jelly will not mould or
shrink so much when covered in this way as when the paper
is pasted over the glass.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Currant Jelly.</h3>

<p class='c011'>After freeing the currants from leaves and stems, put
them in the preserving kettle and set on the range. Crush
the fruit with a wooden vegetable masher, and stir frequently
until heated to the boiling point. Have a large
square of cheese-cloth in a strainer which is set over a
bowl. Turn the crushed fruit and juice into this and let
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>it stand long enough to drain thoroughly. Do not use any
pressure to extract the juice. Have a flannel bag suspended
over a bowl, and pour the strained juice into this. Now
measure the liquid, and put it into a clean preserving kettle.
When it boils up, add a scant quart of sugar for every
generous quart of fruit juice. Stir until the sugar is all dissolved
and the liquid begins to bubble; then strain through
a clean piece of cheese-cloth into a bowl. Immediately
fill the tumblers, which must be dry and warm. Let them
stand uncovered until the jelly is set, then cover with a
round of paper, and over this tie a thin sheet of cotton
batting; or paper may be pasted over the glasses. If you
use the glasses that come with covers, nothing else will be required
except the first sheet of paper. Many housekeepers
prefer to use even less sugar than the amount given, allowing
only a pint and a half of sugar to each quart of fruit
juice.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Currant Jelly, No. 2.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Pick the currants free from stems and leaves, and put
them, a few quarts at a time, in a large earthen or granite-ware
dish, and crush them with a vegetable masher. Put
the crushed fruit into a square of cheese-cloth, and press
out the juice. Put the strained juice into the preserving
kettle and set on the fire. When it boils, skim it well;
then turn it into a flannel bag and let it drain into an
earthen bowl. Do not press the juice through the bag.
Measure this strained juice, and put it on the fire in a
clean preserving kettle. Let it boil for five minutes. Now
add a pint of granulated sugar for every pint of currant
juice. Stir the mixture until it begins to boil. Boil for
just one minute; then fill the glasses, which must be warm,
and set them in a sunny window until the jelly is firm. It
may require only a few hours’ time for this, and it may take
even a day or two; all depends upon the condition of the
currants.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>A much clearer and handsomer jelly is made by putting
the currant juice, when it has been strained the second time,
into the clean kettle, and adding, when it comes to the boiling
point, the sugar; then stirring until the sugar is dissolved,
and filling the glasses immediately. Set in the sun
until the jelly becomes firm. It will take two or three
days. This is called sun-cooked jelly. The currants must
be in perfect condition for this kind of jelly; just ripe, and
freshly picked.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Crab Apple Jelly.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Wash the fruit and put it in a preserving kettle with just
enough water to cover it. Let it simmer for one hour.
Have a piece of cheese-cloth in a strainer that is set over
a bowl, and turn the cooked fruit and liquid into it. Let this
drain well; then strain the liquid through a clean flannel
bag. Measure it, and place on the fire, in the preserving
kettle. Boil for ten minutes, counting from the time it
begins to boil; then add the sugar, using a pint and a half
for every quart of juice. When this boils up, strain through
clean cheese-cloth, and fill warm tumblers. Cover when the
jelly is set.</p>

<p class='c009'>Peach, apple, and quince jellies may be made in this
way.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Other Jellies.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Jelly can be made from any of the small juicy fruits in
the same manner as currant jelly.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXII.<br /> <br />FOR THOSE WHO LIVE ON FARMS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c005'>LIFE on a farm has its bright and dark sides, as does life
elsewhere. If all other things were equal, the pure air,
abundance of sunshine, plentiful supply of good milk, butter,
eggs, vegetables, and fruit should make the farmer’s family
the healthiest and happiest of any class in the land. But to
counterbalance all these advantages there are the monotony
of life and food, and often unwholesome water, where one
would expect to find only the purest. The farmer’s wife
or daughter need not feel that she is buried; that she is
nobody; that she has no mission in life; that she is largely
a drudge. Every honest man or woman, unless we exclude
some of the very rich, must do some work. Now, this
work, whether it be in the kitchen, shop, on the farm, in
the counting-room, store, or any of the professions, may
become drudgery or may be made in some degree a pleasure.
Everything depends upon the home life. The mission
of the farmer’s wife and daughter is one of great
responsibility. It means the physical, mental, and moral
health of the entire family. I know of no class of women
whose mission means more to humanity.</p>

<p class='c009'>Have the home sweet and healthful. Remember that
pure air and sunshine in the house are the greatest purifiers.
Do not exclude them. Impure water carries poison through
the system more effectually than if it were in solid food.
Water may look clear and sparkling, yet be filled with the
germs of disease. A well never should be placed where
the sewage from the house or barn can filter into it. If the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>well be near the house, do not allow slops, suds, etc., to be
thrown on the ground near it. If there be a drain to carry
off the household slops and suds it should be laid as far as
possible from the well and so constructed that there shall
be no leakage. Whatever else you may lack, be firm in
your efforts to have pure water, and pure air and sunshine
in plenty in the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>Try to get as much variety in your food as possible,
especially in the matter of the more substantial things,
such as vegetables, meats, fish, soups, and breads. Try
to educate your family and yourself up to the point where
pies, cake, doughnuts, etc. need not be a daily dish on your
table. Instead of these, have plenty of fresh stewed fruits
when in season, and canned fruits at other periods. These
fruits, with good bread, rolls, rusk, buns, etc., are healthful,
and so simple that one does not tire of them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Learn to make simple puddings and other desserts for the
noonday meal. If you follow these suggestions you will
reap a rich reward in a healthy, clear-headed family. You
must think for yourself, too. Keep up, as much as possible,
with the outside world. Take a part of a day at least once
a week to meet other people, and manage to get in a visit
to town now and then. Read some bright new books. Do
not devote all your spare moments to fancy work or the
trimming of underclothing for yourself and your children;
you would be wasting your energies and making extra work
for ironing day. Keep yourself, as much as is in your power,
a bright, happy, thinking woman, and you will be an inspiration
and tower of strength to your family and neighborhood.
This, perhaps, seems a little like a sermon, but I mean every
word of it.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>To Prepare Meat for Corning.</h3>

<p class='c011'>All meats should be kept until free from animal heat
before being put into brine. This will take at least forty-eight
hours. Have the meat cut into suitable pieces and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>sprinkled lightly with fine salt and saltpetre in the proportion
of one tablespoonful of saltpetre to four of salt. Lay
the meat on a board that is slightly inclined, so that the
surface blood which is drawn from the meat can run off.
At the end of forty-eight or more hours put it in the brine.</p>

<p class='c009'>All meats should be completely covered with brine. If
there be any tendency to float, lay pieces of board on the
meat and put weights on these. Large stones will answer.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Pickle for any Kind of Meat.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>12 gallons of water.</div>
      <div class='line'>3 gallons of salt.</div>
      <div class='line'>3/4 pound of saltpetre.</div>
      <div class='line'>3 pounds of brown sugar.</div>
      <div class='line'>2 ounces of potash or washing soda.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Put all the ingredients in a large kettle and set on the fire.
Stir frequently, and skim until clear; then pour into a large
tub, being careful not to turn in the sediment. Any kind of
meat may be put into this pickle when cold. Beef should
remain in the pickle from one to four or five weeks, as one
may desire it slightly or thoroughly salted.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Pickle for Tongues.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>2 ounces of washing soda.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Prepare this pickle the same as directed for meat pickle.
It will require ten or twelve days’ time to pickle the tongues.
If the flavor of juniper berries be liked, simmer half a pound
in one quart of water for one hour; then strain the liquid
into the brine.</p>

  <h3 class='c010'>To Cure Hams.</h3>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>8 hams of good size.</div>
      <div class='line'>8 quarts of fine salt.</div>
      <div class='line'>4 quarts of brown sugar.</div>
      <div class='line'>4 ounces of saltpetre.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 ounce of washing soda.</div>
      <div class='line'>1/2 ounce of ground mace.</div>
      <div class='line'>1/2 ounce of ground clove.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Mix all the ingredients together and rub thoroughly into
the hams. Pack the meat in a cask or tub having the
skin side down. After three weeks change the top layer to
the bottom. Let the hams lie in pickle for six or seven
weeks; then wash them, and wipe them dry, and finally
hang them up to smoke. It will take from one to two
weeks to smoke them. They are often smoked three
months.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hams may be pickled in a brine such as is prepared for
tongues. They should remain in it from four to six weeks,
if they are to be kept through the year.</p>

<p class='c009'>If you have no smoke-house, six or eight hams can be
smoked in a hogshead. Fasten a strong piece of board or
joist across the top of the hogshead and suspend the hams
from this. Have an old tin or iron pan in which to make the
fire. For fuel use corn cobs, green hickory, or oak chips.
About twenty corn cobs are enough to use at a time. Have
some ashes in the bottom of the pan. Put some live wood
coals on this, and then pile on the corn cobs or chips, and
place all under the hogshead. Cover the hogshead with
several thicknesses of old quilts and carpets. This is to
keep in the smoke and also to check the fire, which should
just smoulder, making a great deal of smoke and little heat.
The fire must be renewed every day. You must be careful
not to get so much fire that the meat will be heated.</p>

<p class='c009'>When thoroughly cured, sew each ham in a thick cotton
bag and hang all in a cool dry place, or pack them.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>To Cure Jowl and Chines.</h3>

<p class='c011'>When a hog is being cut up, take out the backbone and
remove the greater part of the fat; then cut the chine in
pieces about a foot long.</p>

<p class='c009'>Split open the head and take out the brains. Next cut
off the snout. Cut the head in two, and cut off the upper
bone to give the cheeks a good shape. Mix three teaspoonfuls
of saltpetre and one cupful of salt. Rub this
over the jowl and chines. Now pack them closely in a
small butter-tub, and place a piece of board and a heavy
weight on top of them. Put two quarts of coarse salt in a
large kettle, and, after setting the kettle on the stove, put
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>in seven quarts of hot water. When this begins to boil,
skim it carefully, and set it away to cool. When this brine
is cold, pour it over the meat. Keep in a cold place. The
jowl and chines will be ready for use in about three weeks;
they will keep for a year.</p>

<p class='c009'>When all the meat has been used, the brine may be
scalded, skimmed, and cooled, and used again for the same
purpose.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>To Cook Jowl.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Wash the jowl, put it in a stewpan and set on the fire.
Cover it with cold water and heat it slowly to the boiling
point. Skim, and set back where it will simmer for three
hours. The water should not more than bubble. Serve
with sliced and boiled turnips and boiled potatoes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Spinach or cabbage boiled in salted water, then drained
and chopped, and seasoned with salt and butter, should be
served with the jowl when possible. Later in the season
substitute beet and other greens for the spinach and cabbage.
In families where economy has to be practised it is
customary to cook the cabbage or greens and the turnips
with the jowl. No butter is then required for seasoning.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Chine Pillau.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>3 gills of boiling water.</div>
      <div class='line'>1/2 pint of rice, scant measure.</div>
      <div class='line'>3 pounds of chine, fresh or salt.</div>
      <div class='line'>1/2 teaspoonful of powdered sage.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 tablespoonful chopped onions.</div>
      <div class='line'>1/2 tablespoonful of flour.</div>
      <div class='line'>1/4 teaspoonful of pepper.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 teaspoonful of salt.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>This is a cheap and savory dish. Wash and wipe the
pieces of chine carefully, and lay them in a small dripping
pan. Sprinkle the powdered sage over them and then cook
for an hour in a moderate oven, being careful not to let the
gravy burn. It is a good plan to set the pan on the grate,
to prevent the bottom from becoming very hot. At the
end of the hour take the meat from the oven and place it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>in a large stewpan. Into the pan in which the meat was
cooked put the chopped onion. Set the pan on top of the
stove and stir the contents until the onion begins to turn a
golden brown; then add the flour, and stir the mixture
until it froths. Gradually add the boiling water, stirring all
the time. Season with salt and pepper. Let this simmer
for five minutes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Wash the rice in three waters, and put it in the stewpan
with the chine. Strain the gravy over this. Cover the
stewpan closely, and set it back where its contents will
hardly simmer for an hour and a half. Serve very hot.</p>

<p class='c009'>Should the chine be very salt, be scant in the measurement
of salt, but if it be fresh, heap the teaspoon as full as
it will hold, and also rub two scant teaspoonfuls of salt
into the chine when it is put in the oven. The onion may
be omitted.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>How to Render Lard.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The best lard is that made from the fat which lies around
the kidneys, and is termed leaf lard. Remove all the skin,
and cut the lard in small pieces. Put it in an iron pot,
and heat slowly, stirring it frequently. Cook it in this
manner until the pieces of fat look shrivelled and straw-colored.
On no account let it get so hot that it will smoke.
Draw the pot back where the lard will partially cool; then
strain it through a piece of cheese-cloth. Tin pails are
satisfactory vessels in which to keep lard. Do not put on
the covers until the lard is cold. Keep in a cool, dry
place.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Hogs’ Head Cheese.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Have the head split, scraped, and thoroughly cleaned.
Put it in a stewpan, with enough boiling water to cover it
generously, and simmer for five hours, skimming the liquid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>several times during the first hour. Place the head on a
platter and remove the bones. When the meat is cold,
chop it fine, and season each solid quart with two tablespoonfuls
of salt, a level teaspoonful of pepper, and a teaspoonful
of powdered and sifted sage. Add to this mixture
half a pint of the water in which the head was boiled. Cook
the mixture slowly for half an hour, and then turn into
deep earthen dishes. Place a plate with a weight on top of
each dish, and put away in a cool place. This cheese will
cut in smooth slices.</p>

<p class='c009'>If spice and other kinds of herbs be liked, they may be
added with the other seasonings.</p>

<p class='c009'>Should a part of the cheese be kept so long that there is
danger of its spoiling, heat it slowly to the boiling point;
then let it simmer for half an hour, and cool as before.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Scrapple.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1/2 of a pig’s head.</div>
      <div class='line'>2 quarts of water.</div>
      <div class='line'>1/2 pint of corn meal, generous measure.</div>
      <div class='line'>2 teaspoonfuls of salt.</div>
      <div class='line'>1/3 teaspoonful of pepper.</div>
      <div class='line'>2 leaves of sage.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Clean the pig’s head and put it in a stewpan with the hot
water. Let it simmer for three hours; then take it from
the fire and cool it. When cold, remove the bones and
chop the meat fine. Add this and the seasonings to the
liquor in which it was boiled, and return to the fire. When
the contents of the stewpan begin to boil, sprinkle in the
meal, stirring all the time. Cook for two hours, stirring
frequently. Rinse a deep bread pan in cold water, and
pour the hot mixture into it. Set away in a cold place.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the scrapple is perfectly cold, cut it into slices
about half an inch thick, and after rolling these in flour, or
breading them, fry until brown.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>Tripe.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Lay the tripe on a table and scrape it with a broad-bladed
knife; then wash it thoroughly in several waters.
Soak it for five or six days in salt and water, changing the
water every other day, and using a quart of salt to three
gallons of water. At the end of this time boil it gently for
ten hours, turning it frequently, that it may not stick to the
bottom of the boiler and burn. When the tripe has been
boiling for eight hours, add half a pint of salt.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boiled tripe may be used plain, with a butter sauce,
or it may be broiled, fried in batter, soused, etc. When
soused it will keep for several weeks.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Soused Tripe.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>8 pounds of boiled tripe.</div>
      <div class='line'>3 pints of vinegar.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 stick of cinnamon.</div>
      <div class='line'>6 whole cloves.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 small blade of mace.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Cut the tripe in pieces and place it in a stone pot. Heat
the vinegar and spice to the boiling point and pour over
the tripe. Set away in a cool place and it will keep for
several weeks. It will be ready for use in twelve hours,
and it may be broiled or fried.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Pigs’ Feet.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Pigs’ feet should be treated in every particular the same
as tripe. After being boiled they may, when cold, be
broiled, or be fried in batter or crumbs. They may be
soused, and then be broiled or fried.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>To Preserve Rennet.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Rennet is the lining membrane of one of the stomachs of
the calf. Select the stomach of a healthy calf, and empty it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>Remove the outer skin and the fat. Wipe the rennet, and
then salt it well, using about half a pint of salt, and putting
the greater part of it in the sack. Let the rennet lie on a
dish for five or six hours, then stretch it on a forked stick.
Cover it with netting, to protect it from flies, and hang it
up in a cool, dry place. When the rennet is dry (which
will be in about a week) put it in a paper bag or a glass
jar, and keep it in a cool, dry place. This rennet may be
used in making cheese or rennet wine.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Rennet Wine.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Wash the rennet, and cut it into small pieces. Put this
in a wide-mouthed bottle, with one quart of sherry. This
will be ready for use in four or five days. Rennet wine is
used with fresh milk to make delicate desserts, such as slip,
rennet custard, etc.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the quart of wine has been used, a second quart
may be poured on the rennet in the bottle.</p>

<p class='c009'>If salted rennet be used, soak it for several hours in cold
water to remove the salt.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Essence of Rennet.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Clean a rennet and cut it into small bits. Put these in
a glass jar with three ounces of salt. Work the salt into
the rennet with a spoon. Now cover the jar, and put in
a cool place for six weeks. At the end of this time add
a gill of rum and a pint of water. Let this stand for two
days; then filter through paper, and bottle for use. This
essence may be employed the same as rennet wine, using
with it any flavor one wishes.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>THE DAIRY.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The suggestions given for the work in the dairy are for
the guidance of the woman who has only the simplest
appliances to work with, and only a small amount of milk
or cream to handle. In the large dairies, with such modern
apparatus as the separator, and other fine machinery, the
process of making butter differs from that outlined in this
chapter. The essentials are always the same, whether it be
in the smallest and most primitive dairy, or in the largest
and most modern. There must be perfect cleanliness and
freedom from odors. Wood floors and racks on shelves
and in refrigerators must be watched carefully; for wood
absorbs the moisture from milk and water, and will taint
milk, butter, and cheese very quickly. The greatest care is
therefore needed, that all the woodwork shall be washed
clean, and dried thoroughly. Guard against letting any of
the wood about the dairy become milk- or water-soaked.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Care of Milk and Cream.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Milk and all the products of milk require the most careful
attention. Thorough cleanliness and good ventilation
are absolutely necessary. Milk, butter, and cream quickly
absorb any odors that there may be near by. If possible,
one room or pantry should be kept exclusively for the
dairy products. If this be impossible keep one side of
the room—that nearest the window—for this purpose.
Never put strong-odored or warm food in this room. Keep
the room scrupulously clean and <i>dry</i>. Every utensil that
is used about milk in any form must be first washed in
cold water, then in hot suds, and finally scalded in clear,
boiling water. Wipe perfectly dry with towels that are
kept for this purpose, and that are washed and scalded
every day. Now put the utensils out in the sun. If the
day be wet, put them by an open window to air. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>milk, cream, butter, etc., that come from such a dairy cannot
fail to be of a superior quality.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the milk is brought in, pour it through a fine
strainer into the pans, and then set the pans in place. If
at any time it be necessary to mix the night and morning
milk, cool the fresh milk before it is added to the older
milk. Adding warm milk to cold milk will cause the whole
mass to spoil quickly.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the cream is being collected for butter making, it
must not be kept so long that it becomes very sour, or in
winter until it becomes bitter. Have a stone jar in which
the cream can be kept. In summer keep it in the coldest
place you have, but in winter it must be kept where it will
become slightly sour, without becoming bitter. Old butter-makers
advise skimming the cream as free as possible from
milk. Every time a batch of cream is added to that in the
jar, stir the contents of the jar, in order to mix thoroughly
the new and old cream.</p>

<p class='c009'>The cream should not be allowed to remain on the milk
until sour. Skim it while both milk and cream are sweet.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Butter Making.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The quality of the butter will depend largely upon the
care of the milk and cream. It will help the butter-maker
to use a thermometer. One suitable for dairy work can be
purchased for twenty-five cents at any store where they
keep such goods, or where they keep dairy supplies. The
cream should be slightly sour, and when put into the churn
the temperature should be from 58° to 60°. In cold
weather place the cream jar in a pan of hot water, and stir
frequently until the cream is raised to the desired temperature;
in hot weather use ice water, if necessary.</p>

<p class='c009'>In churning it is important that the stroke shall be slow
and steady. Rapid churning causes the cream to froth,
and spoils the texture of the butter. It should take at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>least from thirty to forty minutes’ churning to bring the
butter.</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as the butter begins to form into small masses,
draw off the buttermilk and pour cold water into the churn.
After a few strokes of the dasher, draw off the water and
pour in fresh cold water, adding a teaspoonful of salt to
every quart of water. Work the butter for a few minutes,
then draw off the water. Put the butter in a wooden bowl
and salt it, allowing one ounce of salt to each pound of
butter. Many butter-makers allow four extra ounces of
salt to every ten pounds of butter. If the butter is to be
packed for future use, this is necessary.</p>

<p class='c009'>Let the salted butter stand in the bowl over night. In
the morning work all the buttermilk and water out of the
butter, and then shape into any form you please. Wet
pieces of thin cotton in salt and water, and wrap the rolls
in them.</p>

<p class='c009'>The less milk there is in the cream, the sooner the butter
will come. The amount of butter to a quart of cream will
depend upon the quality of the cream. A quart of thick
cream will give a pound of butter, whereas it may take
more than two quarts of thin cream to produce the same
amount.</p>

<p class='c009'>If only one cow be kept for family use, a small stone
churn will be found valuable for churning the small quantities
of cream which one will have. Of course, a patent
churn is better for large quantities, as the work can be done
more easily with it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Too much working makes the butter tough and waxy.
Work it only enough to free it from water and buttermilk.
Never have the hands touch the butter; use wooden paddles
for the work.</p>

<p class='c009'>If the cream be very cold it will froth, and the butter will
be a long time in coming. When it does come, it will be
light and spongy, instead of being smooth and firm. Most
winter butter lacks color. If you wish to impart a yellow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>tinge to it, grate the dark orange part of the carrot, and
simmer it in sweet milk for twenty minutes. Strain the
milk, and, when cool, add to the cream in the churn. Use
half a pint of grated carrot and a pint of milk for every
eight quarts of cream.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Cottage Cheese.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Put a pan of thick sour milk over a stewpan of hot
water, and heat almost to the boiling point. When the pan
has been over the water for about six minutes, turn the
thick milk gently with a large spoon, getting the hot part
on top. When the whey becomes so hot that it cannot be
touched by the finger, turn the mass into a strainer and let
the whey drain off. When the curd is free from whey,
season it with salt and butter, allowing one teaspoonful of
salt and one tablespoonful of butter to every four quarts of
sour milk. A gill of thick, sweet cream, also, may be stirred
into the curd. Press the cheese into a bowl, or shape it
into balls. This cheese is good only while it is fresh.</p>

<p class='c009'>Be careful not to have the milk too sour, or to get the
curd too hot.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXIII.<br /> <br />CARE OF THE SICK.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c005'>IN every household the time comes when a knowledge of
the proper care of the sick is desirable. One should
not wait for the necessity to arise before acquiring this
knowledge. The physician will do his part, but the care
and food are as important as are his medicines. In a book
of this kind there is not space completely to cover the subject
of preparation of food for the sick, much less the care
of the sick. It is hoped, however, that the simple instructions
given in this chapter may help the inexperienced
to bring comfort and health to their suffering ones.
In the body of the book there will be found directions for
preparing many kinds of simple dishes that are suitable for
the invalid, such as simple soups, broiled meat, fish, and
birds, vegetables, toasts, jellies, and simple desserts.</p>

<p class='c009'>All the food prepared for the sick should be of the best
quality, and cooked in the simplest and most careful manner.
The service should be the daintiest the house affords.
Let the tray be covered with a clean, well-ironed napkin,
and the china, glass, and silver be clean and bright. Tea,
coffee, or chocolate should be taken to the sick-room in a
small pot and poured in the presence of the patient. Have
the cream and sugar in a small pitcher and bowl. Serve
broth or soup in a dainty bouillon cup or a pretty little bowl.
Put cream or milk toast in a small dish and serve small
portions on a pretty plate. Serve dry toast in a fresh napkin,
and butter portions as the patient requires. Broiled
meat or fish should be put on a warm plate, and another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>warm plate be placed over this to keep the food hot while
it is being carried to the patient’s room.</p>

<p class='c009'>A patient should not have to wait for food beyond the
regular time. No one, unless he has been ill, can understand
the terrible sinking feeling that comes to a weak
patient if the time for his taking food is forgotten.</p>

<p class='c009'>In caring for the sick an infinite amount of patience,
sympathy, and cheerfulness is required. If one be harsh or
neglectful, even once, it may mean a whole life of regret.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Cleanliness and Ventilation.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The bedding, the clothes of the patient, and the rooms
must be kept absolutely sweet and clean. If it be impossible
to sweep the room, all dust may be wiped from the floor
with a dry cloth. If the room be carpeted,—which is a pity
when one is sick,—brush it with a soft hair brush, and then
wipe the carpet with a cloth wrung out of warm water. If
possible, ventilate the room two or three times a day by
having the wind sweep through it. Protect the patient by
extra blankets, and then spread a sheet or blanket over the
head board, letting it come down over the head and shoulders
of the patient. One cannot realize what a restful tonic
this pure air is for the patient.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Bathing.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Few things are more refreshing to a sick person than a
sponge bath. It should be given morning and night. A
little alcohol in the water is invigorating, and prevents the
patient from taking cold. Have but little water in the
sponge, and begin with the face and neck. Keep the body
covered, and wash only a small part at one time. Wipe
with a soft towel. At night the patient may be rubbed with
alcohol, using the hand. This rubbing often insures a good
night’s rest. Rubbing is beneficial at almost any time.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>Turpentine Applications.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Refined turpentine is often very valuable in the sick-room.
In cases of inflammation of the bowels, kidneys, or bladder,
and of congestion of the lungs, a turpentine application often
will relieve the most intense pain. Indeed, this remedy is
good and safe for almost any pain that can be reached by
external applications.</p>

<p class='c009'>There are two ways of using the applications. When the
turpentine is to remain on the patient for a long time, mix
it with lard, and spread the mixture on flannel. Lay this
on the seat of pain. It may be kept on for several hours.
Use a tablespoonful of spirits of turpentine to half a pint of
lard. If the pain be intense, two or three tablespoonfuls of
turpentine may be used.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another method is to wring flannel out of hot water,
sprinkle the turpentine on this, and lay the flannel on the
seat of pain. Cover with a dry flannel, and upon this lay
a soft towel. Use a teaspoonful of turpentine for a surface
about a foot square. In case of great pain even more
turpentine may be required. Few patients can endure this
hot application more than twenty minutes or half an hour.
When the flannel is removed cover the inflamed part with
a piece of soft linen.</p>

<p class='c009'>If the pain come from gas in the stomach or bowels,
put eight or ten drops of spirits of turpentine on a lump of
sugar and let the patient eat this. Turpentine is very good
to give in this way whenever there is bloating of the bowels
from an accumulation of gas.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>To Relieve Neuralgia.</h3>

<p class='c011'>When one is suffering from neuralgia in the head, put him
in a warm bed. Make a brick very hot and cover it with
several thicknesses of flannel. Fold a coarse, thick cloth
and place it on the pillow. Lay the brick on this and wet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>thoroughly with rum. Rest the most painful part of the
head or face on the brick, and throw a blanket over the
patient, covering the head. Keep covered in this way until
the pain ceases. When the blanket is removed, wipe the
moisture from the head, face, and neck; then bathe in
alcohol or rum, to prevent taking cold.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another remedy is to make salt very hot by stirring it
over the fire in a frying-pan; then pour it into a bag, which
should be securely tied. Have the patient lie down, and
cover him well. Place the bag of hot salt on that part of
the head or face where the pain is located. The salt will
retain the heat a long time. This method is much easier
than the first, but it will not relieve one so quickly nor so
thoroughly.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>To Keep Cracked Ice.</h3>

<p class='c011'>It often happens that a patient is obliged to take a great
deal of cracked ice. In such a case make a bag of rather
thin flannel, and cut a small hole in the bottom. Have a
long tape run in the hem at the top. Hang this bag in a
large pitcher, fastening it at the top with the tape. Fill
the bag with cracked ice, and cover the pitcher with several
thicknesses of flannel.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>To Break Ice in a Sick Room.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Place the piece of ice on a napkin and press a large pin
or needle firmly into it. It will break off smoothly at this
point. If ice be scarce, it is best to put it in the flannel
bag in one large piece and chip it off as required.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Mutton Broth.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1 pound of the scraggy end of the neck of mutton.</div>
      <div class='line'>1-1/2 pints of cold water.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 tablespoonful of barley.</div>
      <div class='line'>1/4 teaspoonful of salt.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>See that the meat is perfectly sweet. Cut off all the fat;
then cut the lean meat in pieces and put it in a stewpan
with the bones and cold water. Place the stewpan on the
stove; and when the broth begins to boil, skim it and set
back where it will just bubble. Put the barley in another
stewpan with a pint of cold water, and place on the fire.
Cook for one hour; then pour off the water, and, after putting
the barley with the broth, cook for three hours longer.
Add the salt, and strain the broth; or, if the patient can
bear it, remove the bones and serve the meat and barley in
the broth.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Chicken Broth.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1/2 of a fowl.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 quart of water.</div>
      <div class='line'>1/2 teaspoonful of salt.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Free the fowl from fat and skin, and cut in small pieces,
breaking the bones. Wash the meat, and, putting it in a
stewpan with the cold water, place it on the fire. When
the broth begins to boil, skim it carefully. Draw the stewpan
back to a cooler part of the range, where the broth will
only bubble for three hours. Add the salt, and strain.</p>

<p class='c009'>A tablespoonful of rice, tapioca, or sago may be cooked
in this broth, if it be thought best for the patient.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Clam Broth.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Get a dozen clams in the shell, and wash them in several
waters; then soak them for an hour in a pan of cold water.
On taking them from the water, put them in a stewpan and
set on the fire. Add a gill of water, and, covering the stewpan,
cook for fifteen minutes. Pour the liquor through
a fine strainer. Taste to see if salt enough. It may be too
salt; in which case add a little boiling water to the broth.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>Mutton Custard.</h3>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1 quart of milk.</div>
      <div class='line'>2 ounces of mutton suet.</div>
      <div class='line'>Stick of cinnamon, 5 inches long.</div>
      <div class='line'>1 tablespoonful of flour.</div>
      <div class='line'>1/2 teaspoonful of salt.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The suet must be from the kidneys; sweet, and free from
all tough membrane. Shred it very fine, and put it in the
double-boiler with the cinnamon and milk; reserving, however,
one gill of the milk. Cook for one hour, then strain.
Return the strained liquid to the double-boiler, and place
on the fire. Mix the flour and cold milk to a smooth paste,
and stir into the hot mixture. Add the salt, and cook for
ten minutes. Give the patient as much of this as he will
willingly take; say, half a pint every four or five hours.
Keep the patient warm and quiet. This is a particularly
good remedy in severe cases of bowel and stomach trouble,
being nourishing and soothing.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Oysters Roasted in the Shell.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Get ten or a dozen good oysters in the shell. Wash the
shells, and place them in an old baking-pan. Put the pan
into a hot oven, keeping it there until the shells begin to
open. Remove the upper shells and place the under ones,
containing the oysters, on a large plate. Serve at once.
The oysters should be seasoned with butter, salt, and
pepper.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Steamed Oysters.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Put eight or ten large oysters in a little fancy dish or
saucer, and place in the steamer. Cook for about five
minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and butter, and serve at
once with hot toast.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Oyster Roast.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Have a slice of crisp toast in a little dish. Put half a
pint of oysters in a saucepan, and set on the fire. When
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>they boil, skim them, and season with salt, pepper, and
butter. Pour the oysters and liquor on the toast and serve
at once.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Beef Tea.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Put in a large-mouthed bottle one pound of beef, free of
fat, and chopped fine. Add to it half a pint of cold water,
and let the mixture stand for an hour. At the end of that
time place the bottle in a saucepan of cold water. Place
the pan on the fire, and heat the water slowly almost to the
boiling point, without letting it boil. Cook the beef for two
hours; then strain, and season with salt.</p>

<p class='c009'>The thick sediment which falls to the bottom when the
tea has stood awhile is the most nutritious part, yet many
people serve only the clear and poorer part to the patient.
It is to keep this sediment (the albuminoids) in a soft,
digestible condition, that care is taken not to let the water
which surrounds the bottle boil. Great heat hardens the
albuminoids.</p>

<p class='c009'>If a patient take a great deal of beef tea, the flavor may
be changed occasionally by putting a piece of stick cinnamon
about an inch square into the bottle with the meat and
water.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Beef Tea, No. 2.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Put into a bowl a pound of beef, free of fat, and chopped
fine. Add half a pint of cold water, and stir well. Place
the bowl in the refrigerator for four hours. When the tea
is to be given to the patient, strain into a saucepan the
quantity required. Season it with salt, and place the saucepan
on the fire. Stir constantly until the tea becomes hot,
but do not let it boil.</p>

<p class='c009'>This tea has a peculiarly bright flavor, and affords a
pleasant change from that made by long steeping in hot
water.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>Beef Juice.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Use a piece of round or flank steak about an inch thick.
Broil it for eight minutes; then put it on a warm plate and,
after cutting it in small pieces, press in the lemon squeezer.
Season with a little salt. This may be fed to the patient;
or a little bread may be soaked in it; or add a little hot
water, and you have beef tea.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Round Steak.</h3>

<p class='c011'>When you cannot get a tender, juicy steak, or when the
patient’s power of mastication is not good, a nutritious and
digestible steak can be prepared from the round of beef.
Lay a thin slice of round steak on a board. Scrape one
surface with a sharp knife until there is nothing left on that
side but the tough fibres; then turn the meat over, and
scrape the other side in like manner. When the tender
meat is scraped off, put it in a small dish. Press this into
a square, having it about half an inch thick. Rub the bars
of a double-broiler with a little butter, and lay the steak
between them. Broil over clear coals for five minutes;
then place on a warm dish, spread a little butter on the
steak, season with salt, and serve at once.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Raw Beef Sandwiches.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Scrape some beef in the manner described for preparing
round steak. Season it generously with salt. After cutting
four slices of stale bread as thin as a wafer, spread the beef
on two of the slices, and lay the other slices on top, pressing
them down carefully. Cut them into pieces about an
inch square. Arrange these tastefully on a fringed napkin
or in a pretty little dish.</p>

<p class='c009'>Have the water boiling in a stewpan. Stir rapidly, and
sprinkle the oatmeal into it, stirring all the while. Cover,
and set back where it will cook gently for two hours. At
the end of that time add the salt, and serve. This gruel
may be strained or not, as may be best for the patient. A
part of the gruel may be poured into a cup and a few spoonfuls
of milk or cream be added to it.</p>

<p class='c009'>If the gruel be liked thick, use four tablespoonfuls of oatmeal.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Indian Meal Gruel.</h3>

<h3 class='c010'>Wine Whey.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Put half a pint of sweet milk into a double-boiler, and
when it boils add a gill of sherry. Stir well, and let it cook
until the curd and whey separate. If the wine be quite
sour, the milk will separate at once; sometimes it is so
sweet that an extra quantity is required to curdle the milk.
If there be any objection to the use of more wine in a case
like this, add a teaspoonful of vinegar. Pour the liquid

must be kept covered all the time the jelly is soaking and
cooking.</p>

<p class='c009'>This jelly is to be used when the patient finds it difficult
to swallow either liquid or solid food. A small piece of it,
placed in the mouth, melts slowly, and is swallowed unconsciously.
The sugar may be omitted, and a gill of port

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXIV.<br /> <br />WHEN CLEANING HOUSE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c005'>THE season of house-cleaning is greeted with different
degrees of welcome, or horror, by the several members
of the family. Some people appear to think there
is no good reason for this annual thorough cleaning of
the house; others, however, are really glad when the
time comes round again, because it furnishes an opportunity
to take account of stock, as it were, discarding the
worthless, and renewing wherever it is necessary. When
the cleaning is finished, pride and content come with the
feeling that rest and comfort can be taken with a clear
conscience in a house that one knows is in good condition
from top to bottom.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>System Absolutely Necessary.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Every house certainly should have a thorough cleaning
every year, that there may be a check put upon the accumulation
of dust or dirt which might breed disease, even if
no other reason influenced the housekeeper. This yearly
cleaning need not be a season of discomfort to the family.
If possible, a little extra help should be engaged; but even
if this be out of the question, the work can be done in such
a way that every one shall not be worn out by the time the
cleaning is finished. Too much should not be attempted
at once. If one room be taken at a time, and be finished
before work is begun in another, the whole house can be
cleaned without any great difficulty. It is always wise, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>possible, to wait until the necessity for furnace or stove
fires is past. If the house be heated by stoves, and there
be some rooms in which a fire is needed only in the coldest
weather, such rooms may be cleaned first, the stoves in the
other rooms being removed later. There should be a perfect
system in doing this work. Housekeepers differ in
regard to the part of the house where the cleaning should
begin, some starting with the attic and others with the
cellar. Since the furnace must be cleaned some time, and
dust may escape through the pipes into the various rooms
above, it seems to me that the proper place to begin is
down-stairs.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Cleaning the Cellar.</h3>

<p class='c011'>In no part of the house is it so important that the cleaning
be thoroughly done as in the cellar. Not a corner
should be slighted. Begin with the furnace. Have the
registers closed in every room. Remove all the cinders
and ashes, and clean out all the flues and pipes. Many
housekeepers have the pipes removed, but the smoke-pipe is
really the only one that it is necessary to take down. This
pipe is liable to rust, because of the moisture it gathers
from the chimney; nevertheless, if there be no way of heating
and drying the house during a cold, damp period in summer
except by building a fire in the furnace, it would be
cheaper to renew this smoke-pipe every few years than run
the risk of having the family made ill from receiving a chill.
While the men are in the house to clean the furnace, it
would be economy to have them clean the flues in the range,
and also the chimneys. Open the cellar windows to bring
everything into the light. Have the coal bins cleaned.
Brush everything free from dust. Now sweep the ceiling
and walls as well as the floor. Brush the walls once more.
Wash the windows and any closets, shelves, or tables there
may be in the cellar.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>Do not Omit Whitewashing.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Now have the walls whitewashed. Before the various
articles stored in the cellar are put back in place, brush
them again. Sweep the floor once more. Paint with black
enamel varnish the iron parts of the furnace, and also any
iron pipes that may be exposed to moisture. An excellent
whitewash may be made by putting eight quarts of unslaked
lime into a large tub, and pouring over it enough
boiling water to make a paste. Stir well, and cover until
cold, stirring occasionally, that the wash may be smooth.
Dissolve one quart of salt in two quarts of hot water. Dissolve
also half an ounce of indigo in about a pint of hot
water. Add these substances to the slaked and cooled
lime. Now beat well, and add enough cold water to make
the mixture the consistency of thin cream. The wash will
then be ready to use.</p>

<p class='c009'>A tub of charcoal and another of lime are excellent
things to keep in the cellar. They make it sweeter and
dryer, and the charcoal is, of course, very convenient to
have on hand for fuel. The unslaked lime should be
put in a tub or barrel, with space for it to expand to twice
its bulk. It slakes in the air and expands rapidly during
the process.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>From Cellar to Attic.</h3>

<p class='c011'>After the cellar is cleaned, the next move is to begin at
the top of the house and work down. It is not safe in these
days, when houses are kept almost as warm in winter as
they become in summer, to take it for granted that anything
is perfectly free from carpet-bugs, moths, and other insects.
Every article in the storeroom should be examined, brushed,
and shaken. All the boxes, drawers, and closets should be
brushed, wiped, and lined with new paper. As a measure
of safety all receptacles should be saturated with naphtha
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>just before their contents are replaced. Woollen goods,
furs, and feathers should be wet with naphtha and folded in
old cotton or linen sheets. They will be perfectly safe for
a year or more, provided they have been thoroughly shaken
and brushed, so that no insects’ eggs remain in them.
Pieces of carpets and other large articles should be hung
out of doors, on lines, before being put away.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having taken care of the closets, drawers, boxes, and
stored goods, the next thing will be to clean the room.
Brush the articles of furniture and set them outside the
room. Brush the walls, ceiling, and windows. After
sweeping the floor wash the windows and woodwork, and
also the floor, wiping very dry. Let the room air for an
hour or more; then return all the articles to their places.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Taking up and Cleaning Carpets.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Have two strong sheets made of unbleached cotton. Remove
the carpet tacks with a tack-lifter, being careful to put
every one of them in a box or bowl. It is not only extremely
painful, but also dangerous, to step on a rusty tack,
and the housekeeper should make it a matter of conscience
to see to it that none are left lying about. When all the
tacks have been removed fold the carpet carefully, lengthwise;
then roll it up and put it in one of the sheets, tying
this. Put the linings in the other sheet. Take both sheets
into the yard or some field near by, and after spreading
the linings, sweep them on both sides, pile them up, and
cover with the sheet. Spread the carpet and beat with a
rattan or long switch. Sweep it, and then turn it over and
beat again. Let it lie on the grass, wrong side up, until
the room is ready.</p>

<p class='c009'>The small yards in city houses are not the proper places
for cleaning carpets, as the dust rises and enters all the
surrounding houses. There is in some cities a law against
beating carpets in such narrow quarters.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>Sweeping and Dusting.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>When the carpet and linings have been removed from
the room, sprinkle the floor with either moistened sawdust,
fine sand, or bits of damp paper; then sweep up the dust.
Go over the floor a second time. Brush the ceiling and
walls of the room and closets, being careful to get every
crack free from dust. Clean, with a small brush, the tops
of the doors and windows, the window sashes, the ledges
and blinds, and all the grooves in the woodwork. For the
walls and ceiling use a broom covered with Canton flannel,
or any old flannel. Let the strokes on the walls be straight
downward. If there be a fireplace in the room spread
thick papers on the hearth and clean both the grate and
fireplace. Take the bedstead apart and lay each piece on
the floor, grooved side up. Be careful that there is not a
particle of dust left in it. Pour naphtha into every groove.
Be generous, for it is not expensive and will hurt nothing.
Have near by a bowl of naphtha, into which dip the ends of
the slats. If there have been any indications of insect life
in the bed or room, spray all the cracks in the floor, walls,
and woodwork. Now sweep the floor for the third time and
wash it with hot diluted lime water, which is made by pouring
four quarts of boiling water upon one quart of quicklime,
and letting the mixture stand covered for several hours;
then pouring into another pail the clear water. Put one
quart of this water to two gallons of hot. The boards will
be made whiter and sweeter by the use of the lime water.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Washing Painted Surfaces.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Next wash the paint. If it be white do not use ordinary
soap. Wring a flannel cloth out of hot water and dip it
lightly in whiting. Rub with this, and then wash off all the
whiting; next wipe with the cloth wrung out of hot water,
and finally rub with a dry flannel until the surface is perfectly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>dry. Have a pointed stick for all the grooves and
corners. If the woodwork be grooved a great deal, as is
now the fashion, a small scrubbing brush, such as is sold
for cleaning kitchen boards, will be found helpful, as a few
strokes the length of a long grooved panel will clean it perfectly.
If soap be preferred to whiting, use the white castile,
as this will not turn the paint yellow, nor will it soften it,
as is apt to be the case with soaps in which the alkali
is strong. Now wash the blinds, then the window casings
and ledges, and finally the glass of the windows.</p>

<p class='c009'>When cleaning paint it is well not to have the cloth so
wet that the water will run on the paint, as it will leave
streaks. Wash only a small place at a time. Wash the
blinds with clear water. When you come to the window
ledges do not use so much water that it will run down
on the outside of the house, marring the appearance of
the walls. Always rub with the grain of the wood.</p>

<p class='c009'>Take the covers from the furniture, and dust again, washing
the mirror in the dressing-case. Clean and polish the
furniture.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Laying the Carpet.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Lay the carpet linings on the floor, putting a small tack
here and there to keep them in place. Put the carpet on
the floor, unrolling it in the direction in which it is to be
laid. Begin to tack it at the end of the room which is the
most irregular. If there be a fireplace or bay-window in
the room, fit the carpet around these places first. Use
large tacks to hold the carpet temporarily in place; they
can be withdrawn when the work is finished. When the
carpet is fitted to a place, use small tacks to keep it down.
Tack one end of the carpet, stretching it well; then a side,
then the other end, and finally the other side. Be careful
to keep the lines straight, and to have the carpet fit tightly;
for if it be loose, it will not only look bad, but will not
wear well.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>When the carpet is laid, pour a little naphtha on any
soiled places, and rub with a piece of flannel until the spots
disappear. Always have a window open at such times, to
allow the gas to escape. Put about six quarts of warm
water in a pail and add four tablespoonfuls of household
ammonia. Wring a woollen cloth out of this, and wipe the
carpet.</p>

<p class='c009'>Put the furniture and other articles in place. When all
the chambers are finished, clean the hall and stairs. All
the chambers and upper halls are to be cleaned in the
same manner, one room at a time. If the stairs be carpeted,
take up the carpets and have them cleaned and put
away until all the front part of the house has been cleaned.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Rooms on the First Floor.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The rooms on this floor nowadays are generally shut off
by portières, over and under which the dust sifts into the
adjoining rooms when one of the series is being cleaned,
unless the housekeeper provide the proper screens. Have
for this purpose sheets of strong, unbleached cotton, a yard
longer and wider than the height and width of the openings.
If you take down your portières and tack these sheets on the
top and at the bottom of the casings, the other rooms will
be well protected. Now dust and remove the small ornaments.
Beat and brush the upholstered furniture. Remove
from the room as much of the furniture as possible.
Take down the window draperies and shake the dust from
them in the yard. Have the dining-room table made its
full length, and lay an old sheet over it. Spread the
draperies on this, one at a time, and wipe them with a
clean piece of cheese-cloth; then fold them carefully, if
they are not to be hung again until fall, and, pinning them
in clean sheets, put them away in boxes or drawers. Next
take down the shades, and after wiping them with a clean
cloth roll them up and put them aside until the room is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>cleaned. Cover the large pieces of furniture, and if there
be carpets to be taken up proceed in these rooms as
directed for the bedrooms. If there be brasses, take them
to the laundry or kitchen to be cleaned. Take down the
shades of the chandeliers and wash them. If the carpets
are to be taken up, they should be removed at once, and if
they are not, brush the ceiling, walls, woodwork, windows,
blinds, and ledges, and then sweep the carpet. When the
dust settles sweep a second time; be careful to brush the
corners and edges thoroughly with a small broom. After
the carpet is thoroughly swept, saturate the edges and corners
with naphtha, leaving the doors and windows open, of
course. Now clean the paint and windows. When the
room is clean put three tablespoonfuls of household ammonia
in about six quarts of water, and, wringing a clean
cloth out of this, wipe the carpet. Change the water as
soon as it becomes dark. Replace the furnishings. Of
course, if the floors be of polished hard wood, half the
burden of house-cleaning is removed.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Kitchen, Pantry, and Closets.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Last, but not least, on the programme comes the back
part of the house. Beginning with the china closet, remove
and wipe all the dishes. Brush the walls, ceiling, and
shelves. Take the drawers to the kitchen and wash and
wipe them, afterward drying them in the sun or before the
fire. Wash all the woodwork and the floors before replacing
the dishes. Clean the kitchen closets and pantry in
the same manner. Wash and scour all the wooden, tin, and
iron utensils, getting them perfectly dry and sweet in the
sunlight, if possible. Line the shelves and floor of the pot
closet with thick brown paper, and put the utensils in
place. Take down the kitchen shades and wipe them with
a clean cloth. Brush the ceiling and walls. If the walls
be painted, wash them in warm ammonia water,—four
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>tablespoonfuls of ammonia to six quarts of water. Have
ready a second pail of clear hot water and a clean cloth.
Go over the washed space with the clean cloth and water;
then wipe dry. If the woodwork be hard or grained, wash
it in the same manner; using, however, only half as much
ammonia. Wash the windows, scour the tables and sink,
clean the pipes and faucets, black the stove, and wash the
floor. When all this is done go over the woodwork with a
flannel dampened with linseed oil and turpentine,—half of
each; then rub with a dry flannel. The laundry and back
halls should receive the same attention. Then the piazza
and yard should be put in order.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXV.<br /> <br />ODD BITS OF USEFUL KNOWLEDGE.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c010'>Points of Difference in Various Brands of Flour.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c011'>MUCH trouble in cooking arises from the difference in
various brands of flour. There are often, indeed,
variations in the same brand. All are caused by the different
modes of making the flour, and changes in the kind of
wheat used.</p>

<p class='c009'>When flour is made by the roller process, two cupfuls
will make a much stiffer batter than flour made by the
old process of grinding between stones, or produced by
first crushing by rollers and then grinding between stones.
Millers all over the country are always looking for, and frequently
making, improvements in the processes which they
are accustomed to follow. This necessarily results in changes
in the texture and quality of their products. Then, too,
it makes a difference whether the wheat used is spring or
winter wheat. In the Eastern States, where mills are few,
the flour comes largely from Minnesota and other Western
States. This flour has in the last fifteen or twenty years
been made almost wholly by the roller process, and chiefly
of spring wheat. The distinguishing quality of this flour is
this: if rubbed between the fingers it feels rough and granular,
and if pressed in the hand it will not hold its shape, but
fall apart as granulated sugar would. When using this flour
by measure, allow one eighth more wetting than for flour
made by grinding between stones.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>Recently a number of millers have modified the new process
by using the rollers for cleansing, separating, and grinding
until the last stages of the work, when the flour is put
between stones and ground smooth and fine. When this
is done the distinguishing features between the old and new
processes are lost. This flour is smooth to the touch, will
keep its shape if pressed in the hand, and will not absorb
as much moisture as the more granular kind. It can be
used equally well for bread, cake, and pastry. Some of the
mills in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan make
this flour in perfection.</p>

<p class='c009'>Flour that is made of new spring wheat will not give so
good bread when first made as it will after it has been kept
for a month or more. A great deal of the trouble with
bread comes from this condition of the flour. A barrel of
flour that will not make good bread to-day, simply because
the wheat was too new when ground, will, if kept for two
months, make perfect bread, if the yeast be good; for,
after all, the yeast is more frequently than the flour the
cause of failure to make satisfactory bread.</p>

<p class='c009'>When one buys flour in small quantities there will always
be an uncertainty as to how it will work until after the first
time it is used. Even in small families it is better to get
flour by the barrel, as it improves with age. Another thing
for the housekeeper to remember is that the whitest flour is
not the most nutritious. What is called first-quality flour
does not contain nearly so large a quantity of the best elements
of the wheat as the second quality, which is much
darker, but gives a sweeter and more nutritious loaf.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is wonderful to see the various processes through which
the wheat goes before it comes out of the mill. There is
no question that flour which is made by the roller process
in the first stages and finally ground between the stones will
give the most satisfaction. The wheat is more thoroughly
cleaned than when the flour is made wholly by the old process,
and the separation of the hard substance and the dust
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>from the wheat is more thorough than by the old mode, and
therefore when the flour comes from the millstones it is free
from undesirable substances.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>When and Why Soda, Cream of Tartar, and Baking</h3>
<p class='c011'>Powders are Used.</p>

<p class='c009'>Soda may be used in all kinds of bread, cake, pudding, and
griddle cakes where an acid also is used. The acid may
be cream of tartar, vinegar, lemon juice, sour milk or cream,
molasses, or something else. If two teaspoonfuls of cream
of tartar be used, there must be one teaspoonful of soda,
save in cases where the cream of tartar is used only to give
tone and firmness of texture to a pudding or cake in which
only the whites of the eggs are employed,—such as many of
the meringue puddings, and angel cake.</p>

<p class='c009'>In puddings and cakes where molasses, lemon juice, or
vinegar is used, soda should be used instead of baking powder,
because the baking powder is a combination of an acid
and alkali, and the proportions are so carefully adjusted that
the two ingredients neutralize each other.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sometimes a rule for cake or gingerbread calls for one
teaspoonful of soda and one of cream of tartar. In such
cases allowance is made for the acid in the molasses, or in
the sour milk or cream that is used. Again, in making
cake in which a good many eggs and wine or brandy are
used, a small quantity of soda, but no cream of tartar, is
called for. This is because there is enough acid in the
wine and butter to neutralize the small quantity of soda and
produce the required amount of carbonic acid gas.</p>

<p class='c009'>It will be seen, by these statements, that the housekeeper
who uses baking powder can do without cream of tartar,
but she must be provided with soda when using molasses
and sour milk and cream.</p>

<p class='c009'>Soda should never be dissolved in hot water, because
some of the gases would be liberated and wasted, and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>greater amount of soda would be needed to make good this
waste than if the soda were dissolved in cold water.</p>

<p class='c009'>Housekeepers should remember, when making biscuit
and dumplings with baking powder, that three teaspoonfuls
of the powder will be required to make one quart of flour
light. The manufacturers’ directions often call for only two,
and the result is unsatisfactory.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>About Whipping Cream.</h3>

<div  class='figleft id031'>
<img src='images/p364.png' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>WHIP-CHURN.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Have the cream very cold. Put it in a bowl or pail, and
set this dish in a pan of cold water,—ice water if possible.
Have a large bowl or pan set in another pan of ice water.
Place the whip-churn in the cream, tipping a little to one
side, that the air and cream may be forced through
the holes in the bottom of the churn. Draw the
dasher up about one third the length of the cylinder;
then press down. Let the upward stroke be light,
and the downward stroke hard. If you will count
time in this way: <i>one</i>, two; <i>one</i>, two,—it will insure
a regular stroke, which is important.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the bowl is full of froth, skim it off into the
larger bowl, being careful not to skim too near the
liquid cream. A little of the froth will become
liquid, but this can be poured back into the bowl
and whipped again.</p>

<p class='c009'>The cream must be neither too thick nor too thin. If
too thick, thin it with milk. When cream is too thick for
whipping, the bubbles will be very small and the cream will
hardly double in volume. This kind of cream makes most
desserts too rich. When the cream is too thin, the bubbles
will be large and clear, and will break when touched. Such
cream as is sold at creameries as thick or heavy cream, and
costs from fifty to eighty cents a quart,—depending on the
locality,—will require a pint of milk to a pint of cream.
The thin cream sold at the creameries is often too poor to
be whipped.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>The whip-churn is a tin cylinder, perforated on the bottom
and sides, in which a dasher of tin, also perforated, can
be easily moved up and down. When this churn is placed
in a bowl of cream and the dasher is worked, air is forced
through the cream, causing it to froth.</p>

<p class='c009'>Good cream may be frothed with a whisk, or with an egg-beater,
but the whip-churn described above is, to my mind,
the most satisfactory for this work.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>How to Prepare Bread Crumbs.</h3>

<p class='c011'>There are two methods of preparing bread crumbs. Such
as are to be used for escaloped dishes or dishes prepared
<i>au gratin</i>, etc., should always be grated. That means, of
course, that stale bread—not dried bread—should be used.
This gives light, fluffy crumbs.</p>

<p class='c009'>For breading, pieces of bread should be dried in a slow
oven until not a particle of moisture is left. The dried
bread should then be put in a bag and pounded fine with a
wooden mallet. Now rub the crumbs through a common
flour sieve, and put them away in glass jars. There should
always be kept on hand a good supply of these dry crumbs.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Breading Articles for Frying.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The albumen of the egg hardens so quickly when exposed
to a high temperature that it is used as a protection for
articles of food that lack albuminous matter enough on the
surface instantly to form a hard coating. The egg does
not take a fine, brown color; therefore, bread or cracker
crumbs are used with it to give the food crispness and
a rich color. Covering an article of food with egg and
bread crumbs is called breading. Put the egg in a deep
plate, and beat it thoroughly with a spoon, but not enough
to make it light. Have the crumbs in another plate, or
they may be spread in a thick bed on a board. Have the
article that is to be breaded seasoned well with salt, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>slightly with pepper, if the latter be used at all. Put the
article in the egg, and with a tablespoon dip up and pour
the egg over every part of it. Not a spot should escape
the coating. With a broad-bladed knife lift the article
from the egg, and roll it in the dried crumbs, being careful
that every part is covered. Lay the breaded food on a flat
dish or on the board until dry.</p>

<p class='c009'>Never place one breaded article on another when drying
or frying. When ready to fry, shake off the loose crumbs.
Place in the wire basket, being careful not to crowd. Fish,
meat, croquettes, etc., when dry after breading, may be
placed in the refrigerator until the time for frying. They
will keep for twelve hours or longer.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sometimes a very thick crust is desired on some kinds
of food. In that case bread all the articles, and when they
are dry, give them a second coat of egg and crumbs.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Ways to Get Onion Juice.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Pare a fresh onion and bruise the side by striking with
the dull edge of a knife; then press the flat side of the
blade of the knife against the bruised place. The juice
will fall in drops. If a large quantity be required, cut the
onion fine, put it in a piece of cheese-cloth, and press in a
lemon squeezer kept solely for this purpose.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Getting Rid of the Odor of Onions.</h3>

<p class='c011'>If the hands and the utensils which were used in preparing
raw onions be thoroughly washed in cold water before soap
or hot water touches them, the odor of the vegetable will
disappear.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Stoning Raisins in an Easy Manner.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Stem the raisins, and, putting them in a bowl, cover with
boiling water. Immediately pour off the water. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>softens the skins and makes the raisins puff up so that the
stones are removed with ease.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>To Freshen Bread and Cake.</h3>

<p class='c011'>If you wish to freshen a stale loaf of bread or cake, put
it in a deep pan, cover it closely and set it in rather a cool
oven for about twenty minutes. The loaf will be almost as
fresh as when first baked, but it must be used the same day,
as it dries quickly when reheated in this manner.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Making a Bouquet of Sweet Herbs.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Tie together one spray of parsley, one sprig each of
thyme and summer savory, one small leaf of sage, and one
large bay leaf. This bouquet will flavor a gallon of soup.
It must not cook in it for more than an hour. When only
a small amount of soup or sauce is to be flavored, the
bouquet should be cooked in the liquid but a short time,—perhaps
from ten to twenty minutes.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Preventing a Meringue from Falling.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The means of preventing a meringue from falling when
it is taken from the oven are simple. Usually the trouble
arises from baking the meringue in too high a temperature.
If you beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff, dry froth, then
gradually beat in the powdered sugar (a generous tablespoonful
for each white of an egg), put the meringue on
the pie or pudding when partially cooled, and bake in a
moderate oven, with the door open, for eighteen to twenty
minutes, the annoyance may be avoided.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>To Temper Iron and Earthen Ware.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Heat the iron slowly and then cool slowly. It is best,
when it can be done, to grease the inside of the iron utensil
and fill it with cold water; then heat the water gradually to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>the boiling point, and cool slowly. Earthenware is to be
put in a kettle of cold water, which is then to be heated
slowly to the boiling point, and cooled slowly. If convenient,
put a little bran in the water.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Flour Paste.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Mix one heaped tablespoonful of flour with five of cold
water. Pour on this a scant gill of boiling water, stirring
all the time. Stir the mixture on the fire until it boils up,
then strain.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>What to do When Burning Accidents Occur.</h3>

<p class='c011'>There are many simple remedies which, in case of burning
accidents, can be applied before the physician comes.
So much immediate and future suffering can be averted by
the prompt use of some remedy, that everybody should
have fixed in mind some of the proper things to do. Slight
burns, such as one often gets in the kitchen or laundry,
can be relieved, and blistering be prevented, by coating
the burned part with oil, lard, or butter, then covering
with baking soda, and finally with a piece of linen. In
a short time the pain will cease, and, unless the burn be
very deep or the remedies be applied too late, there will be
no blister. Lime water also is good for burns.</p>

<p class='c009'>Children are often scalded by falling into hot water left
within their reach, or by overturning some hot liquid upon
themselves. In a case of scalding it must be remembered
that the clothes clinging to the body are saturated with the
hot liquid, and that as long as they are allowed to remain
in this condition the heat will be kept in, and the burn
become deeper. The first thing to do in a case of this
kind is to pour cold water over the sufferer. This at once
cools the clothing, which should afterward be taken off as
gently but quickly as possible. Next pour sweet oil over
the burns and cover them with soda, if you have it; if not,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>cover with soft linen cloths, and then wet with lime water.
If there be no oil at hand, lard will do. The things at
which to aim are, to cover the burn at once with some pure
oily substance and then with soda or lime water, to take
out the fire; to have the place covered with linen, which
will not stick to the wound; and, finally, to cover closely
from the air. Nothing is better for this purpose than a thin
roll of cotton batting spread over the linen. Sometimes the
cotton batting is saturated with oil and laid directly on the
wound; but it is apt to cling to the flesh, and cause much
trouble and suffering. A fine quality of cotton batting may
be obtained at any druggist’s.</p>

<p class='c009'>In every house there should be a closet or drawer on the
first floor where a few simple remedies are kept. Here is
a list for burns: a roll of old linen, such as handkerchiefs,
napkins, pieces of table-cloths, sheets, and pillow-cases; a
roll of cotton batting, a bottle of sweet oil, with the stopple
drawn and gently put back, so that it can be quickly removed;
a bottle of lime water; a box of powdered baking
soda; a ball of soft darning cotton; and a needle, thread,
thimble, and scissors. One may have no use for these
things in many years; but the trouble of keeping them is
trifling, and should there be need of them the advantage of
having them ready for use is beyond estimation.</p>

<p class='c009'>To make lime water, put about half a pound of unslaked
lime in an earthen bowl, and pour over it three pints of
boiling water. Stir with a stick, and put away in a cool
place for eight or ten hours. At the end of that time pour
off the clear lime water, letting the sediment remain in the
bowl. Bottle the water, and put the stopple in, but not so
far that it cannot be easily drawn.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Use of Naphtha in the Household.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Naphtha has come to be a power in cleaning establishments,
and to some extent in the household. Before giving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>any directions for its use, I want to state that this fluid is
extremely dangerous unless ample precautions be taken;
but with proper care there is not the slightest danger.
Naphtha is very volatile, giving off a highly inflammable
gas. It is dangerous even to have an uncorked bottle of
it in a room where there is a light or fire. If, however,
when naphtha is being used, the windows in the room be
open and there be neither light nor fire, there will not be
a particle of danger.</p>

<p class='c009'>Soiled carpets and garments may be cleaned by sponging
with naphtha. Buffalo bugs and moths can be destroyed
with it. For stuffed furniture use naphtha freely. Put the
article on the piazza and pour the fluid into it, being sure
that every part is saturated. After a day or two, repeat the
process, and I think you will find that both worms and
eggs are destroyed. Still, it will be necessary to keep a
close watch; for it is more difficult to destroy the eggs
than the worms, and they may be hatched out after days,
or even weeks, have passed. I know that if the naphtha be
used again at this time the trouble will be at an end. Furs
and woollen garments should be well beaten, and then saturated
with naphtha. There is no danger in this generous
use of the fluid out of doors; but in the house great care
must be exercised. Windows should be opened, and there
should be no light or fire in the room for several days, if
naphtha has been used in large quantities.</p>

<p class='c009'>When rugs or carpets are attacked, have two hot flat-irons
ready. Wet with hot water the parts that are affected.
Place several thicknesses of wet cloth over this, and apply
the hot iron, which should stand there for at least ten minutes,
that the steam may penetrate every part. When all
is done, pour on naphtha; also, pour it about the edges of
the carpet. Remember that wiping with naphtha has no
effect; it must be a generous bath. Let me say again,
that the danger from the fluid comes from the gas, and that
the windows are to be opened, and no fire or light allowed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>in the room during the work, or for a few hours after it is
done.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bedbugs can be banished from a room with two or three
applications of naphtha. Take the bed apart and dust it.
Let the parts lie flat on the floor with the grooved sides up.
Saturate the bed with naphtha, filling the grooves. Pour
the fluid into the pillows and mattresses, wetting the seams
and tuftings thoroughly. Spray any cracks there may be in
the walls. If there be a carpet on the floor it will be well
to give it a naphtha bath, to clean and brighten it. When
all this is done, close the room, leaving the windows open.
It should stand in this way for at least eight hours, that
the gas may pass off. Should any bugs appear after this,
repeat the operation. The second time will not fail.</p>

<p class='c009'>When putting away furs, flannels, rugs, etc., have the
articles well beaten. Put them in sheets, and wet with
naphtha; then pin the sheets and put the articles away
in boxes or drawers.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>A Word Regarding Stains.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Stains of all kinds are constantly getting on all sorts of
articles and fabrics. Great care must be used in removing
them, as the treatment that is good for one kind will produce
the most disastrous results with another. A few simple
remedies are given for the most common stains that
trouble the housekeeper.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>To Remove Grease Spots.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Where soap and hot water can be used, wash the spots
in very hot water, using plenty of soap; then rinse well.
French chalk or fuller’s earth may be powdered and mixed
with cold water, to make a thick paste. Spread this on the
grease spot and let it remain for several days; then brush
off. If the stain has not fully disappeared, apply the mixture
a second time.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>Oxgall may be used on dark colors; if purified, it may
be used on any color. It can sometimes be bought at a
druggist’s in a purified state. Chemists also combine oxgall
with turpentine and other cleaning agents. This preparation
is effective and safe in removing grease.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the case of delicate fabrics that can be washed, the
spots may be rubbed with yolk of egg before the washing.
Naphtha is usually effective in removing grease.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here is still another way. Put a piece of blotting paper
under the grease spot and another over it. Place a warm
iron on the upper one. After a while remove the iron and
paper, and, if the grease has not entirely disappeared, repeat
the process with fresh paper.</p>

<p class='c009'>If a large amount of oil or grease be spilled on a flat surface,
immediately cover the place thickly with whiting, wheat
flour, or meal of any kind. This will absorb some of the
oily substance, and prevent it from spreading. After an
hour or two brush off this substance and apply the usual
remedies.</p>

<p class='c009'>Grease spots on carpets may be taken out by covering
the spots with fuller’s earth, wet with spirits of turpentine.
Let it stand until the earth is a fine dry powder.</p>

<p class='c009'>Delicate fabrics, like silk, crêpe, ribbons, scarfs, etc., may
be spread on a clean cloth and then be covered with powdered
French chalk or fuller’s earth. Roll up the article
and put away for a few weeks and it will become clean.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>To Take Grease from Wood and Stone.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Put one gill of washing soda and one quart of boiling
water in a stewpan and place on the fire. When the soda
is dissolved, pour the boiling liquid on the grease spot.
Rub with an old broom. An hour or two later rub with a
mop. Rinse out the mop; then wash with clean hot water.
Be careful not to get the soda water on your hands, clothing,
or boots.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>Removing Stains from Marble.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>If the stains were made by grease, spread wet whiting
or chloride of lime on them and let it remain for several
hours; then wash off. Washing soda, dissolved in hot
water, mixed with enough whiting to form a thick paste,
and kept on the stains for several hours, will remove grease
spots.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sometimes the marble has a discolored appearance from
scratches. If it be rubbed hard with wet whiting and then
washed and wiped dry, the mark will disappear. Ink and
iron rust are usually removed with an acid, but if that be
employed on marble, it will dissolve the stone. The remedies
given for grease spots can, however, be used. Should
an acid be used on marble, pour ammonia water on the spot
and it will neutralize the acid, thus saving the marble.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Treatment of Fruit Stains.</h3>

<p class='c011'>One of the simplest methods is to place the stained part
of the cloth over a bowl and continue pouring boiling water
through until the stain disappears. If this be done soon
after the article is stained, there will be no trouble in most
cases.</p>

<p class='c009'>Oxalic acid will remove fruit stains. As it is useful for
many purposes, it is well to keep a bottle of it in some safe
place. Put three ounces of the crystals in a bottle with half
a pint of water. Mark the bottle plainly.</p>

<p class='c009'>When stains are to be removed have a large pail of water
and a bottle of household ammonia at hand. Wet the
stained parts with the acid and then rub. When the stains
have disappeared, put the article in the water. Wash thoroughly
in several waters, and then wet the parts with the
ammonia, that all trace of the acid may be removed.
Finally, rinse again.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>Coffee, Tea, and Wine Stains on Table Linen.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>If treated at once such stains seldom give much trouble.
Place the stained part over a large bowl and pour boiling
water upon it until the stain disappears. If, however, the
stains be of long standing, and have been washed with soap,
it will be difficult to get rid of them. Javelle water (which
can be made at home or bought of a druggist) will do it.
Put about half a pint of Javelle water and a quart of clear
water into an earthen bowl; let the stained article soak in
this for several hours; then rinse thoroughly in three waters.
It is only white goods that can be treated in this manner, as
the Javelle water bleaches out the color. Another way to
do is to put a little of the Javelle water in a saucer or small
bowl, and soak the spot in this until it disappears. Rinse
thoroughly.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>When Cloths become Mildewed.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Put about a tablespoonful of chloride of lime in a wooden
pail, or earthen bowl, and add four quarts of cold water.
Stir until all the lime is dissolved, using a wooden spoon or
paddle. Now put the mildewed article into the water and
work it about, using the spoon or paddle. Let the article
stay in the water until all the mildew has disappeared; then
throw it into a tub of cold water. Wash well in this, and
then rinse in a second tub of cold water; finally, wring out
and dry. If the rinsing be thorough the fabric will be
uninjured. It is only white goods that can be treated in
this way, because chloride of lime removes colors as well as
mildew.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>The Best Way to remove Iron Rust.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Buy four ounces of muriatic acid at a druggist’s. It is
useful for various purposes. Have it marked plainly. It
should, moreover, be labelled as poisonous.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>Fill a large bowl with boiling water. Have another bowl
or pan full of hot water. A bottle of household ammonia
also is necessary. Place the spotted part of the garment
over the bowl of hot water. Wet a cork in the muriatic
acid and touch the iron rust with it. Immediately the spot
will turn a bright yellow. Dip at once in the hot water, and
the stain will disappear. When all the spots have been removed,
rinse the article thoroughly in several clear waters,
then in ammonia water (a tablespoonful of household
ammonia to a quart of water), and finally in clear water.
The acid is very powerful, and will destroy the fabric if
allowed to remain upon it. Ammonia neutralizes it. If the
directions be followed carefully, the most delicate fabric can
be successfully treated in this way.</p>

<p class='c009'>As muriatic acid is very destructive of tin, do not keep
the bottle in the same closet with articles made of that
metal.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Removing Blood Stains.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Wash the stain in blood-warm water until the greater part
has been removed; then rub on some soap, and wash until
the stain disappears. When the stain is on white cotton or
linen goods, scald the article after it has been washed.
Never use hot water until the stain is nearly removed.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Removing Sewing-machine Oil Stains.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Rub the stain with sweet oil or lard, and let it stand for
several hours; then wash in soap and cold water.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>To Remove Pitch and Tar.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Rub lard on the stain and let it stand for a few hours;
then sponge with spirits of turpentine until the stain is
removed. If the color of the fabric be affected, sponge it
with chloroform and the color will be restored.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>Alcohol for Grass Stains.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Rub the stain with alcohol; then wash in clean water.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Muriatic Acid for Stains on Porcelain.</h3>

<p class='c011'>When there is a great deal of iron in the water, the porcelain
or china bowls in the bath-room become badly
stained. Rub a little muriatic acid on the stained parts,
and rinse thoroughly with cold water, adding a little ammonia
to the rinsing water toward the end.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>To Remove Paint.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Wet the paint with turpentine and rub with a woollen
cloth. If the paint spot can be kept wet with the turpentine
for a little while, it will not require so much rubbing.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Removing Ink Stains.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Tear blotting paper in pieces and hold the rough edges
on the ink when it is freshly spilled. If you have no blotting
paper at hand, cover the spot with Indian meal; or,
the liquid ink may be absorbed by cotton batting. The
first care should be to prevent the ink from spreading. If
ink be spilled upon a carpet, cut a lemon in two, remove a
part of the rind, and rub the lemon on the stain. As the
lemon becomes stained with the ink, slice it off, and rub
with the clean part. Continue this until the stain is
removed.</p>

<p class='c009'>If the stained article be washed immediately in several
waters and then in milk, letting it soak in the milk for
several hours, the stain will disappear.</p>

<p class='c009'>Washing the article immediately in vinegar and water, and
then in soap and water, will remove all ordinary ink stains.</p>

<p class='c009'>Washing at once in water and then in liquid citric acid
or oxalic acid is another mode. Oxalic acid is very corrosive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>and should be removed from the article by a thorough
washing in water. If, after the washing, the article be wet with
household ammonia, any acid remaining will be neutralized.</p>

<p class='c009'>No matter what substance be used to remove ink, the
stain must be rubbed well. If the article stained be a carpet
on the floor, use a brush. As the acids often affect the
colors in a fabric, it is wise to try the water and milk or
the water and vinegar method before resorting to the acids.
Chemicals should always be the last resort, unless one be
rather familiar with their action.</p>

<p class='c009'>My own experience is that it is a most difficult matter to
remove the stains of some kinds of black ink if they have
stood for a few hours; whereas, other kinds, notably stylographic
ink spots, can be removed easily with soap and
water.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>When Acids are Spilled.</h3>

<p class='c011'>A bottle of household ammonia should be kept where it
can be reached conveniently at any time; then, when an
acid is accidentally spilled, pour ammonia over the spot at
once.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Restoring Colors.</h3>

<p class='c011'>When an acid has been spilled on a fabric its effect may
be neutralized by sponging with ammonia. If an alkali,
such as ammonia, soda, potash, etc., be spilled on a garment,
its effect may be neutralized by sponging with weak
vinegar.</p>

<p class='c009'>If the color be not fully restored, sponge with chloroform.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>To make Javelle Water.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Into a large saucepan, porcelain-lined if possible, put four
pounds of bicarbonate of soda and four quarts of hot water.
Stir frequently with a wooden stick until the soda is dissolved;
then add one pound of chloride of lime, and stir
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>occasionally until nearly all the solids are dissolved. Let
the liquid cool in the kettle; then strain the clear part
through a piece of cheese-cloth into wide-mouthed bottles.
Put in the stoppers and set away for use. The part that is
not clear can be put into separate bottles and used for cleaning
white floors and tables; also for cleaning the sink.</p>

<p class='c009'>In making this preparation be careful not to spatter it on
your clothing or on the paint. Half a pint of this water can
be put into a tub with about a dozen pails of warm suds,
and the soiled white clothes be soaked in them. Much of
the dirt can be removed by this method. The French laundresses
use this preparation for white clothes.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>A Good Cleaning Fluid.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Put into a large saucepan two quarts of water, half an
ounce of borax, and four ounces of white castile soap shaved
fine, and stir frequently until the soap and borax are dissolved;
then take from the fire and add two quarts of cold
water. When the mixture is cold, add one ounce of glycerine,
one of ether, and four of ammonia crystals. Bottle
and put away for use; it will keep for years.</p>

<p class='c009'>To clean an article, first brush thoroughly, and then spread
on a table. Sponge with the cleaning fluid and rub hard
until the stains disappear. Then press if necessary.</p>

<p class='c009'>This fluid will remove grease spots and stains of various
kinds. It can be used on silks, cottons, and woollens. It
is almost invaluable for cleaning men’s clothing, dresses,
carpets, etc. When a colored garment is to be sponged, try
the fluid on a small piece of the goods, as it affects some
colors.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Treatment of Grease Spots on Wall Paper.</h3>

<p class='c011'>If you find grease spots on wall paper, put powdered
French chalk, wet with cold water, over the places, and let
it remain for twelve hours or more. When you brush off
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>the chalk, if the grease spots have not disappeared, put on
more chalk, place a piece of coarse brown paper or blotting
paper on this, and press for a few minutes with a warm
flat-iron.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Stale Bread for Cleaning Soiled Paper.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Wipe the paper with a clean cloth. Cut a loaf of stale
bread in two, lengthwise, and rub the bread over the paper,
making long strokes straight up and down. When the bread
becomes soiled, cut off a thin slice, and continue the work
with the clean surface. A large room may require the use
of two or three loaves.</p>

<p class='c009'>Edges of books, margins of pictures, and other things
may be cleaned in the same way.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Two Ways to Repair Wall Paper.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Have a set of children’s paints, selecting those that have
creams, browns, yellows, and perhaps green, blue, and red.
Mix the colors until you get the shade of the foundation
color of the paper, then lightly touch up the broken places.
If the breaks be small this will be all that is necessary; but
if large, it will be well when the first color is dry to touch
up the place with the other colors. This is a much easier
and more satisfactory method than patching the paper. If,
however, the broken place be too large to be repaired with
the paint, match the paper if you can and stick it on with
flour paste. Never use mucilage, as it discolors the paper.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Brightening Leather Furniture.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Housekeepers often wonder if it is possible to restore
the color to leather furniture which has become rusty in
appearance. Furniture dealers say that real leather should
not fade as long as it holds together. However, it does
fade; so try this method of brightening it. Wash the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>leather with a sponge that has been wrung out of hot soap
suds; then rub as dry as possible. Now place the furniture
in the sun and wind, that it may get thoroughly dry as quickly
as possible. Next, rub hard with a cloth that has been wet
with kerosene. Let the furniture stand in the air until the
odor of the oil has passed off.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Preventing Silks and Woollens from Turning</h3>
<p class='c011'>Yellow.</p>

<p class='c009'>Whenever you have occasion to pack away silk or woollen
goods which you are afraid may turn yellow, break up a few
cakes of white beeswax and fold the pieces loosely in old
handkerchiefs that are worn thin. Place these among the
goods. If possible, pin the silks or woollens in some
old white linen sheets or garments. If it be inconvenient
to use linen, take cotton sheets. Of course, it is important
that the clothing shall be perfectly clean when put away.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Cleaning Dress Silks and Ribbons.</h3>

<p class='c011'>There are several methods of cleaning silks. They may
be spread on a clean table and sponged with naphtha, alcohol,
soap and water, etc.; or the silk may be washed in soap
suds, gasoline or naphtha. As the gasoline or naphtha does
not affect the colors, it is more desirable for colored silks.</p>

<p class='c009'>If the silks be washed in suds, use the best white castile
soap. Wash the silk in the suds; then rinse in clear water
and hang on a clothes-horse in the shade. Do not wring it.
When the silk is nearly dry lay it on a soft ironing cloth, and,
after spreading either coarse brown paper or a newspaper
over it, press with rather a cool iron. If naphtha or gasoline
be used, have the liquid in a large bowl near an open window,
and in a room where there is neither fire nor light.
Wash the silk in this and hang in the air. It will dry
quickly.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>Black silk may be washed in ammonia water and rinsed
in clear water to which has been added strong bluing and
dissolved gelatine,—one quarter of an ounce of gelatine
to one gallon of water.</p>

<p class='c009'>Never iron silk unless it is absolutely necessary.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Cleaning Chamois Skins.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Chamois skins that have been used for cleaning silver,
brass, etc., can be made as soft and clean as new by following
these directions. Put six tablespoonfuls of household
ammonia into a bowl with a quart of tepid water. Let the
chamois skin soak in this water for an hour. Work it about
with a spoon, pressing out as much of the dirt as possible;
then lift it into a large basin of tepid water, and rub well
with the hands. Rinse in fresh waters until clean, then
dry in the shade. When dry, rub between the hands.
Chamois jackets can be washed in the same manner, except
that there should be two quarts of water to the six tablespoonfuls
of ammonia. Pull into shape before drying.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>To Clean Brushes.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Put enough warm water in a flat bowl or pan to cover
the bristles, but not to come over the back of the brush.
To each quart of water put three tablespoonfuls of household
ammonia. Lay the brushes in this for about five
minutes, then work them gently in the water. Rinse thoroughly
in cold water, and rest them on the edge where a
current of air will strike them.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Care of Straw Matting.</h3>

<p class='c011'>This floor covering should not be washed often. Boil
together for one hour two quarts of bran and four of
water. Strain this, pressing all moisture out of the bran.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>Add two quarts of cold water and two tablespoonfuls of
salt to the strained mixture. Wash the matting with this
and rub dry with a clean cloth.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>To Clean Woods in Natural Finish.</h3>

<p class='c011'>To clean woodwork in your halls and rooms do not wash
it. Soap destroys the looks of woodwork that is finished in
natural colors. Wring a flannel cloth out of hot water and
wipe off the dust. When all the woodwork has been dusted
in this manner go over it with a woollen cloth made damp
with cotton-seed or sweet oil and alcohol or turpentine; two
parts oil and one alcohol or turpentine. Rub hard, and
with the grain of the wood; then rub with clean flannel.
It will revive the color and gloss. Light woods must be
wiped with a damp flannel and polished with a dry piece of
flannel. Do not use oil on light woods.</p>

<p class='c009'>To clean the railing of banisters, wash off all the dirt
with soap and water, and when dry rub with two parts of
linseed oil and one of turpentine.</p>

<p class='c009'>All dark woods that have become soiled and dingy may
be washed with soap and water, using, if possible, a piece
of flannel. Dry with a soft cloth. Mix together two parts
of linseed oil and one of turpentine. Moisten an old piece
of flannel in this and rub the furniture with it. Finish by
rubbing hard, and with the grain, with a dry old piece of
flannel. If there be any white stains rub them with kerosene,
using a good deal of oil and much pressure.</p>

<p class='c009'>The soiled wood may be cleaned with turpentine instead
of soap and water.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>To Remove White Stains from Furniture.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Wet a woollen cloth with kerosene and rub the spot until
the stain disappears. It may take a good deal of hard
rubbing if the stain be deep or of long standing, but perseverance
will accomplish the object.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>Cleaning Brass.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>There are many good preparations which come for cleaning
brass. The most of them do the work quickly, leaving
a brilliant polish, but the metal does not keep clean so
long as when cleaned by the old method. Pound fine and
then sift half a pint of rotten-stone. Add to this half a gill
of turpentine and enough sweet oil to make a thick paste.
Wash the brasses in soap and water, wipe dry, and then
rub with the paste. Rub with a soft clean rag, and polish
with a piece of chamois skin.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Conveniences when Sweeping.</h3>

<p class='c011'>If one have proper covers for the pictures and heavy
pieces of furniture in the room, a great amount of trouble
can be saved on the sweeping day. Buy cheap print cloth
for the furniture. Have three breadths in the cover, and
have it three yards and a half long. It should be hemmed,
and the work can be done quickly on a sewing-machine.
I find six cloths a convenient number, although we do not
always need so many. Get cheap unbleached cotton, and
cut it into lengths suitable for covering pictures, heavy ornaments,
clocks, etc. These need not be hemmed. Always
remove any coverings gently; then take them out of doors
to be shaken. Fold them and put them away. They will
last a long time, and pay for themselves in a year, because
they save so much extra dusting, and the moving of heavy
articles.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Mending Breaks in Plaster.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Mix together half a pint of powdered lime, one gill of
plaster of Paris, and cold water enough to make a thick
paste. Fill the holes with this and smooth the surface with
a knife. Work quickly. If there be many breaks mix only
as much plaster as can be used in ten minutes, as it hardens
quickly.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>Another method is to fill the breaks with putty. When
the plaster or putty is dry, the places can be touched with
water colors to correspond with the rest of the wall.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Cement for Stoves and Iron Ware.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Mix together enough water glass and iron filings to make
a thick paste. Apply this to the cracks or holes, and heat
gradually almost to a red heat. This substance will bear a
white heat, although of course one would rarely have occasion
to test it to this degree. The water glass and iron
filings can be bought at a druggist’s.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Cement for China.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Dissolve one ounce of powdered gum-arabic in a gill of
boiling water. Stir enough plaster of Paris into the liquid to
make it the consistency of thick cream. Use immediately.</p>

<hr class='c023' />

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Another Rule.</span>—Powder quicklime and stir it into
the white of an egg, making rather a thick paste. Coat
the broken edges lightly with this, and tie the pieces
together.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>How to Fasten Handles of Knives and Forks.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Mix together two ounces of powdered rosin, one ounce
of powdered sulphur, and one ounce of iron filings. Keep
these in a box, and, when a knife or fork becomes loosened
from the handle, fill the opening in the handle with the
powdered mixture. Heat the tang of the instrument and
press it into the handle. Should it not go in to the hilt,
heat again, and the second attempt will be successful.</p>

<p class='c009'>Do not pack the powder into the opening. Should the
powder blaze up when the heated metal is inserted, blow
out the flame. Be careful to turn the fork-tines or knife-blade
around until in the right position, before the filling
becomes hard.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>Value of a Drop of Oil.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Every housekeeper knows how annoying it is to have the
hinges of the doors squeak, and the locks and bolts refuse
to move unless great force be used. Many do not realize
that a few drops of oil will, as a rule, remedy these annoyances.
First spread a newspaper on that part of the floor
over which the hinges swing. Now, with the sewing-machine
oil can, oil the hinges thoroughly, and then swing
the door back and forth until it moves without noise.
Wipe the hinges, but let the paper remain for a few hours,
to guard against the possible dripping of oil. For locks
and bolts, protect the floor in the same manner. Oil them
thoroughly, working them until they will move with ease.
The egg-beater and the ice-cream freezer should be oiled
frequently in the same manner.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>What to do when the Chimney is Cold.</h3>

<p class='c011'>When lighting a fire where the chimney has not been
used for some time, start the current of air upward by
burning a paper in the stove pipe, or by holding it in the
chimney, if it be a grate fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>If the heat has been turned off from a room for some
time it occasionally happens that the heated air will not
come through the pipe when it is turned on again. In that
case close for a few minutes nearly all the registers which
serve as outlets for the other pipes, and the heat will be
forced into the cold pipe. After this it will go that way
naturally.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>To Prevent Kid from Cracking.</h3>

<p class='c011'>When kid boots require a dressing, rub a little castor oil
into the kid before the dressing is put on. This will keep
the leather soft.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>Testing the Oven Heat with Paper.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Have white paper for testing the heat of the oven. Put
a piece on the bottom of the oven and close the door. For
pastry, the oven should be hot enough to turn the paper
dark brown in five minutes; for bread, the heat should
turn it in six minutes. All kinds of muffins can be baked
at this heat. Cup cakes should be put into an oven that
will turn a piece of white paper dark yellow in five minutes.
Sponge and pound cakes require heat that will turn white
paper light yellow in five minutes. Bread requires great
heat at first; later, the heat is to be reduced. Cake
should have rather a cool oven. The heat can be increased
later.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Oven Thermometers.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Many efforts have been made to produce a thermometer
which will indicate the temperature of the oven, but, so far
as I know, none made with mercury have been satisfactory.
There is made in this country, however, an “oven clock,”
which can be set into the door of the oven. This is based
on the principle of the contraction and expansion of the
metals. To get the greatest benefit from these clocks the
housekeeper must make her tests herself; that is, she must
learn that when the hand points to a certain number the
oven is right for roasting; when at another point, that the
heat is right for baking bread, cake, etc. After she has
established these facts, she may write out a table which will
serve as a safe guide in the future.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Ridding the House of Water Bugs.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Strew powdered borax about the pipes and in any cracks
in the walls or woodwork where water bugs appear. If
this be persisted in, and everything be kept perfectly clean,
you can rid the house of the insects.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>Keeping Flies from Chandeliers.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Wipe the chandeliers with a soft cloth that has been wet
in kerosene oil. This should be done several times during
the summer. Fly specks can be wiped off in the same manner,
even when on gilt picture frames; but the cloth must
be only slightly moistened in the latter case, and used lightly,
else the gilt itself may come off.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Driving away Ants.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Put green walnuts around the places where the ants come
and they will disappear; or, strew fresh pennyroyal around.
If it is impossible to get the fresh herb, use the oil. Tar
mixed with hot water, and placed in bowls or jars in the
room or closet, will often drive away these pests.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Care of the Hands.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Doing housework is apt to make the hands become rough.
Have thick gloves to wear when making fires and cleaning
stoves and grates. Wear, when sweeping and dusting, old
gloves that fit loosely. As much as possible use one kind
of soap; changes of soap and water irritate the hands.
Have soft hand-towels in the kitchen, and always wipe the
hands perfectly dry. When the work is done rub the hands
with bran and vinegar diluted with water. Rinse them in
tepid water and wipe perfectly dry. Rub a little cold
cream into the hands at night, and also, if convenient, after
the coarse work has been done for the day.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>Cold Cream.</h3>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>

      <div class='line'>2 ounces of cocoa butter.</div>

<p class='c009'>Break up the wax, spermaceti, and cocoa butter. Put all
the ingredients into a bowl, and place this in a pan of boiling
water. Stir the mixture until it becomes a soft, smooth
mass; then put it in little jars, and keep in a cool dry place.
This is excellent for the hands and face. In winter use
only one ounce of spermaceti.</p>

<p>QUART MEASURE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The ordinary kitchen cup is supposed to hold half a pint,
and nearly all writers of cook-books base their measurements
on this understanding. Nearly all first-class
kitchen furnishing stores keep what are
known as measuring cups. They are made of
tin, and hold half a pint, old measure. One
cup is divided into four parts, and one into
three. A set of these cups will be found of
the greatest value in the kitchen, as they insure accurate
measurements.</p>

have such cups to work with:—</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
